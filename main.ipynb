         "By . Anthony Bond . PUBLISHED: . 07:03 EST, 2 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 08:07 EST, 2 March 2013 . Three members of the same family who died in a static caravan from carbon monoxide poisoning would have been unconscious 'within minutes', investigators said today. The bodies of married couple John and Audrey Cook were discovered alongside their daughter, Maureen, at the mobile home they shared on Tremarle Home Park in Camborne, west Cornwall. The inquests have now opened into the deaths last Saturday, with investigators saying the three died along with the family's pet dog, of carbon monoxide poisoning from a cooker. Tragic: The inquests have opened into the deaths of three members of the same family who were found in their static caravan last weekend. John and Audrey Cook are pictured . Awful: The family died following carbon monoxide poisoning at this caravan at the Tremarle Home Park in Camborne, Cornwall . It is also believed there was no working carbon monoxide detector in the static caravan. Cornwall Fire and Rescue Service said this would have resulted in the three being unconscious 'within minutes', . A spokesman for Cornwall coroner Dr Emma Carlyon confirmed the inquests were opened and adjourned yesterday afternoon. They will resume at a later date. Devon and Cornwall Police confirmed on Monday that carbon monoxide poisoning had been established as the cause of death. A police spokesman said the source of the poisoning was 'believed to be from incorrect operation of the gas cooker'. Poisoning: This woman left flowers outside the caravan following the deaths. It has emerged that the trio would have been unconscious 'within minutes' Touching: This tribute was left outside the caravan following news of the deaths . Early readings from experts at the site revealed a potentially lethal level of carbon monoxide present within the caravan at the time it was taken, shortly after the discovery of the bodies. Friends and neighbours have paid tribute to the trio. One . neighbour, Sonya Owen, 53, said: 'It's very distressing. I knew the . daughter, she was living her with her mum and dad. Everybody is really . upset.' Margaret Holmes, 65, who lived near the couple and their . daughter, said: 'They had lived here for around 40 years and they kept . themselves to themselves. 'I just can’t believe this has . happened, it is so sad and I am so shocked, I think we all are, you just . don’t expect this sort of thing to happen on your doorstep. 'Everyone will miss them, we used to chat a lot when we were both in the garden. 'I would just like to send my condolences to their family, I can’t imagine what they’re going through.' Nic Clark, 52, who was good friends with daughter Maureen, added: 'They were a lovely kind family, a great trio. 'Maureen . used to go out and walk her dog, a little Jack Russell, it is so sad . what has happened, I understand the dog went with them. 'They . will be sorely missed and I think everyone is just in shock at the . moment, I would like to send my condolences to the Cook family.'"

         "NEW: Libya can serve as example of cooperation, White House spokesman says . Resolution calls for preventing nuclear weapons from being stolen, used by military . Obama, Russian President Dimitry Medvedev working to reduce stockpiles . Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez on \"Larry King Live\" tonight, 9 ET .",
         "UNITED NATIONS (CNN) -- A rare meeting of U.N. Security Council heads of state, led for the first time by a U.S. president, adopted a resolution focused on stopping the spread of nuclear weapons Thursday. President Obama is the first U.S. leader to head a United Nations Security Council meeting. President Obama challenged the gathering -- which included leaders of nuclear powers including Russia, China, Great Britain and France -- to overcome cynicism against the goal of ridding the planet of nuclear arms. \"We harbor no illusions about the difficulty of bringing about a world without nuclear weapons,\" Obama said, adding that Thursday's meeting signaled a significant step forward in cooperative global action. The resolution, which was adopted unanimously, calls for tighter controls on nuclear materials to prevent them from being used for military purposes or stolen. It also encourages enforcement of international treaties and U.N. resolutions regarding nuclear non-proliferation, particularly when nations such as Iran and North Korea are in violation. \"The world must stand together,\" Obama said. \"We must demonstrate that international law is not an empty promise.\" It was the first Security Council summit chaired by a U.S. president, and only the fifth time that Security Council heads of state have met. Obama led the meeting because the United States holds the revolving presidency of the Security Council in September. Both Obama and Russian President Dimitry Medvedev, who spoke later, said the world's two nuclear superpowers were working on reducing their stockpiles in advance of a global nuclear summit scheduled for next year. \"It's obvious that an effective solution ... depends on the constructive engagement of all parties,\" Medvedev said, adding that he expected the Russia-U.S. leadership on the issue to be backed by \"all nuclear powers.\" The measure passed Thursday -- Security Council resolution 1887 -- calls for \"locking down vulnerable nuclear weapons materials in four years\" while minimizing civilian use of weapons-grade uranium. It encourages full compliance with all international treaties and resolutions on nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament, including Security Council resolutions that cite North Korea and Iran for failing to adhere to international commitments. In addition, the resolution supports the peaceful use of nuclear energy, a theme backed by Chinese President Hu Jintao. China seeks to expand its nuclear energy capacity as part of an economic development plan that holds down greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change. British Prime Minister Gordon Brown also cited the role of nuclear power as a clean energy source that should be part of the solution to global warming affecting every nation. Brown and other leaders spoke of the need to prevent nuclear weapons or the materials to make them from ending up in the hands of terrorist groups. \"The biggest risk the world faces today is of extremists getting hold of nuclear materials,\" said Mohammad ElBaradei, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency. Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, who criticized the Security Council on Wednesday in a rambling speech to the U.N. General Assembly, was absent for the meeting. In Libya's turn to speak at the summit, its special representative to the United Nations called for the IAEA to inspect all nuclear programs, including Israel's, instead of focusing on non-nuclear states. Asked later about Gadhafi's absence, White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said Libya could serve as an example to Iran and North Korea as a nation that gave up its nuclear weapons program and now had rejoined the full international community. \"I think the message that the Libyans had at the Security Council is a message that we hope that the Iranians and the North Koreans will take to heart, and that is giving up a nuclear weapons program and the benefits that it can have for international cooperation and for their reintegration into an international community,\" Gibbs said. Brown earlier called for sanctions against Iran for its efforts to develop a nuclear weapon. On Wednesday, Medvedev signaled that Russia -- which previously has opposed such move -- also could support sanctions against Iran. \"Russia's position is clear: sanctions rarely lead to productive results, but in some cases sanctions are inevitable,\" Medvedev said in a joint appearance with Obama after they met in New York. The statement bolsters U.S.-led efforts for increased international pressure on Iran to adhere to nonproliferation agreements in pursuing the development of nuclear energy. Iran claims its nuclear program is intended for peaceful purposes, but the international community accuses it of continuing to try to develop nuclear weapons capability. The Iranian mission to the United Nations released a statement after the Security Council meeting, saying the country's nuclear activities \"are and always have been, for peaceful purposes, and, therefore, pose no threat whatsoever.\" \"In practicing its legitimate right to develop nuclear energy technology, Iran has always maintained its need for nuclear power as an alternative source of energy to supply its booming population and rapid development. ... Our commitment to nonproliferation remains intact,\" the statement added. The United States and Russia previously have disagreed over Iran, and over possible steps the Security Council may take -- including imposing sanctions -- to push Tehran to comply with U.N. demands concerning its nuclear program. Last week, Obama announced that the United States was dropping plans to base a missile defense shield system in Poland and the Czech Republic, a proposal that had rankled Moscow. He has denied the change was directly linked to Russia's position regarding sanctions on Iran, but said any Russian shift in that direction would be a bonus."

Report claims he was made aware of misconduct 19 times but did not act . Despite this - he still holds influential post and sits in the House of Lords .",
         "Cover-up: Former Archbishop Lord Hope allowed a paedophile priest to escape punishment for sex crimes, a judge's report claims . A former archbishop who failed to act on alleged crimes of a paedophile priest should be jailed, the abuser’s victims have said. Lord Hope, the former Archbishop of York, did not act on 19 occasions when allegations of abuse or inappropriate conduct by the priest were raised with him, a scathing report revealed yesterday. But despite that, Lord Hope remains as an honorary assistant bishop in the Diocese of Bradford. Eli Ward and Bim Atkinson, who were among seven victims of the Very Reverend Robert Waddington, former Dean of Manchester, said it is ‘incredible’ that the man who did nothing to stop the priest has been allowed to keep his post. The report by Judge Sally Cahill QC said Lord Hope failed to act because his ‘concern for the welfare of Robert Waddington seems to have been paramount’. Waddington, who kept an official position in the church until 2005 and died in 2007, targeted young choirboys over several decades. One of the seven victims committed suicide in 1989. Mr Atkinson, 59, who was abused when Waddington was a priest in Australia in the 1960s, sent a picture of disgraced Tory peer Lord Archer, who was jailed for perjury, to the Bishop of North Queensland Bill Ray, adding: ‘I would be pushing for Lord Hope to be treated in the same way as this fellow.’ Mr Ward, now 41, was abused by Waddington between the ages of 11 and 15 as a chorister at Manchester Cathedral. He said: ‘It’s just incredible Lord Hope still has a position. Here is a guy who shoved it all under the carpet. 'He failed and failed to do anything and yet nothing has happened to him. He is still allowed to sit in the House of Lords.’ He added: ‘I’d like to see him punished. My opinion is that he’s committed a crime, perverting the course of justice, and should face the consequences.’ Robert Waddington died in 2007 - he had been accused of abusing seven different victims between 1955 and 1996 . Mr Ward said he left the choir when he was 15 after church officials became concerned – but the priest was allowed to remain as the dean in charge of the cathedral until 1993. Waddington then moved to York Minster, where more children were abused. He stayed in a lesser post there until 2005, despite the allegations made to Lord Hope, according to the report, which was commissioned by current Archbishop of York, the Most Reverend John Sentamu. Mr Ward said: ‘Here we had a church body which had been preaching at us to be morally correct yet, when it came to doing the same thing themselves, they were incapable.’ Mr Ward, now living in the Home Counties with a long-term girlfriend, added that he has put the abuse behind him. But he believes Waddington’s abuse was responsible for the death of another victim, a former chorister from Carlisle named in the report only as Peter, who was abused in the 1970s, developed depression and schizophrenia, and committed suicide in 1989. Lord Hope, 76, has described Judge Cahill’s report as ‘flawed’ but offered a ‘personal and profound apology’. He said: ‘This report makes it clear that not applying the policy is not the same as a cover-up. Hindsight is a wonderful thing.’"

         "By . Kristie Lau . PUBLISHED: . 10:48 EST, 14 June 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 11:02 EST, 14 June 2012 . TLC has pulled an episode of Cake Boss from future screening schedules after receiving complaints over the show's mishandling of a transgender guest star. The episode, which aired on Monday night, showed transgender Carmen Carerra, 27, who was born as a man, take part in a stunt that she believed was edited to look distasteful. The stunt involved Buddy 'Cake Boss' Valastro, the reality show's star, tricking Anthony 'Cousin Anthony' Bellifemine into believing that Miss Carerra was born as a woman. Controversy: TLC have halted all future airings of Monday night's episode of Cake Boss which featured a transgender woman (right) and one of the show's stars Anthony Bellifemine (left), after receiving complaints .

After the episode aired, Miss Carerra, a . former star of the reality series RuPaul's Drag Race, wrote on her Facebook page that she believed the show turned her involvement into a . 'Jerry Springer, \"THAT'S A MAN\" kind of thing'. The New Jersey-based transgender woman claimed that she had signed onto the show as an example of how 'a beautiful transgendered woman' can get 'hit on at a bar' and 'IT'S OK!'. Glamour: Miss Carerra, seen above in New York on February 3, rose to fame as a contestant on the reality TV show RuPaul's Drag Race . Fans of Miss Carerra wrote on her Facebook page about their disappointment over the show. One person wrote: 'This whole thing sucks... you are so beautiful and talented. You don't need to build your career on being a victim.' Another wrote: 'The last time I checked transgender meant born in the wrong body... so my final statement is . \"YOU ARE A FULL BLOWN, VERY REAL WOMAN!\".' TLC told the Los Angeles Times: 'TLC can confirm that the episode was immediately removed from rotation after learning of Carmen Carrera and her supporters' concerns, and the network is reviewing the content to see whether it could be reintroduced following edits.' Repeats of the episode did not run but the network added that the episode may air again without the controversial scene.

He went right for her.' Footage . then shows Miss Carrerra flirting with Mr Bellifemine in a bar as the . pair down shots of liquor and she even gives him a peck on the cheek.

Producers . on the show even show footage of the reactions of onlookers in the bar, . as they attempt to depict horror spreading throughout the entire scene . as a result of the reveal. Mr Valastro tells the cameras: 'So . Carmen was all about having fun and pranking Anthony, she loves little . pranks like this... Carmen loved the fact that they thought she was . attractive.' He adds: 'That's a man, baby!' The . guest star is seen telling the cameras later in the scene: 'Listen, it . was so easy to get Anthony. Ladies out there, all you need to do is . dress really, really cute and put on some pink lip gloss and Anthony . will be all over you.' Joker: Buddy 'Cake Boss' Valastro is shown to have set up the stunt and says: 'Carmen loves little pranks' Trick: Miss Carerra (right) is shown flirting with Mr Bellifemine (left) who is unaware that she was born a man . Chemistry: Mr Bellifemine is clearly taken by the woman, posing for a picture with her for an onlooker . Miss Carerra wrote after viewing the episode: 'LET ME MAKE THIS VERY CLEAR! LISTEN UP PEOPLE! I signed on to do this . episode of Cake Boss to promote EQUALITY. Transgender women are just . as beautiful as biological woman and should be respected for that.' She continued: 'The reveal was never meant to be a \"Jerry . Springer, THAT'S A MAN...\" kind of thing. I was promised that it wasn't . going to be that way. I was lied to. I don't promote misleading someone . or putting down the trans community. I am a beautiful transgendered . woman and if a guy hits on me at a bar, ITS OK! That was the message. 'Hearing things like \"You'll never be a real woman\"... is the . EXACT TYPE OF IGNORANCE THAT THIS SHOW HELPED TO PROMOTE,' she wrote. ' This is why I'm . so upset. If men find me attractive and treat me as a lady, why do some . of you people think it's wrong??? Why are some of you trying to take that . away from me like I dont deserve to be treated with respect and . admiration? Ignorance, that's why. STOP THE HATE AND PASS THIS ON.' Disgust: The subject of the prank is immediately turned off Miss Carerra when he learns her secret . Onlookers: The episode even includes footage of other bar goers (above) looking on in shock . Unaware: Miss Carerra (right) claimed she did not know the prank would treat her sexuality with insensitivity . She even launched a petition on the website Change.org in an attempt to receive an apology from TLC over the representation. It reads: 'Before filming, Carmen educated . producers on what terms to use and what phrases would not be offensive, . i.e. \"Carmen was BORN male\" or \"Carmen is a transgendered woman\". Producers AGREED to respect her wishes, however, when the show aired it . was a blatant \"THAT'S A MAN\" moment.' The petition received more than 8,800 signatures."

         "'The lamps are going out all over Europe. We shall not see them lit again in our lifetime' Foreign Secretary Sir Edward Grey, August 3, 1914 . Prime Minister David Cameron is urging Britons to switch off their lights for an hour tomorrow evening to mark the 100th anniversary of Britain’s declaration of war on Germany in 1914. The Lights Out initiative will be the culmination of a day of commemorative events across the country and in Europe, with members of the Royal Family fully involved at home and abroad. Millions of homes, offices and public and private buildings, such as Tower Bridge and 10 Downing Street, will be included in the ‘shared moment of reflection’ between 10pm and 11pm, leaving just a single candle or bulb illuminating a window as a symbol of ‘continuing hope in the darkness’. The initiative was inspired by then Foreign Secretary Sir Edward Grey’s remark at the outbreak of the First World War: ‘The lamps are going out all over Europe. We shall not see them lit again in our lifetime.’ Mr Cameron told The Mail on Sunday: ‘Lights Out is a way for everyone to mark the First World War centenary and I would encourage people to take part and turn off their lights tomorrow at 10pm for an hour, apart from a single light or candle. ‘This will be a personal gesture in remembrance of all those who made the ultimate sacrifice for us 100 years ago. They must never be forgotten.’ The national commemorations will begin with a morning service of prayers, hymns and readings in Glasgow Cathedral linked to the conclusion of the Commonwealth Games. The event will be attended by Commonwealth leaders, Mr Cameron and Prince Charles. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will attend a remembrance service in Liege, Belgium, before joining Prince Harry and Mr Cameron for a commemoration organised by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission in Mons, where the first and last British soldiers who died on the Western Front are buried. At 10pm, to coincide with the start of the ‘Lights Out’ initiative, a vigil service will be held at Westminster Abbey during which members of the congregation will extinguish candles until there is just one left alight on the tomb of the unknown soldier, which will be snuffed out by the Duchess of Cornwall. Scroll down for video . Poignant: Young drummers in Sandhurst, Berkshire, will lead a special service . During the day, there will be a number of Church of England services attended by other members of the Royal family including the Queen, who will be at Balmoral in Scotland, and Prince Philip, at Sandringham in Norfolk. Other special events will be held up and down the UK, including a commemorative service led by Sandhurst and District Corps of Drums in Berkshire. Labour’s spokesman on the First World War commemorations, Dan Jarvis, said: ‘With the busy lives we lead today, the simple act of pausing, switching off the lights and lighting a candle will be a very powerful tribute.’"

         "Roy Hodgson has come under fire for making public Raheem Sterling's admission that he was feeling tired ahead of England's Euro 2016 qualifier with Estonia. The Liverpool star told the England manager that he was too fatigued to start the match in Tallinn after shouldering a heavy burden this season for both club and country. Hodgson then made Sterling's comments public ahead of the match, which England won 1-0 thanks to Wayne Rooney's second-half free-kick. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Roy Hodgson: Raheem came to me complaining of tiredness . England manager Roy Hodgson was criticised for making public Raheem Sterling's admission that he was feeling tired ahead of Sunday's Euro 2016 win over Estonia . Sterling did not make England's starting XI in Tallinn but came on as a second-half substitute . Sterling was replaced by his Liverpool teammate Adam Lallana in the starting line-up but came on as a second-half substitute. Sky Sports pundits and former Liverpool players Jamie Redknapp and Jamie Carragher both criticised Hodgson for not keeping their conversation private. Redknapp said: 'I would never have dreamed of saying that  to an England manager, but then I picked up a lot of injuries. 'I'm sure Brendan Rodgers would have been leaning on him,  you need a break and this is an opportunity to get one. 'Why on earth did Hodgson say it though? Honesty is not the best policy. Why has Roy got into this? He could have said 'I want to freshen this up.' This wouldn't even be a conversation.' Sky Sports pundit Jamie Redknapp said Hodgson should have kept the conversation with Sterling private . Jamie Carragher, also talking on Sky Sports, agreed that Hodgson should have used more discretion . Carragher agreed that discretion would have been a better idea: 'Me as a player, I would never give a manager a chance to leave me out. 'But keep it between yourselves, just come out and say Lallana played well last game and say Raheem needs a rest. But now we are having a debate on it. 'Hodgson could have been more careful, but I don't think Rodgers would have been involved.' Sterling, 19, came off the bench to win the 74th-minute free-kick that led to England skipper Rooney curled in for his 43rd international goal. Hodgson said after the game: 'People don't like it when you simplistically tell the truth. We were training at The Grove doing a light session but some work in how we wanted to play the game tactically. Hodgson chats to Sterling during training on the eve of the match in Tallinn, which England won 1-0 . Sterling's Liverpool teammate Adam Lallana started in his place in the England midfield diamond . 'Just before we started, Raheem had done the warm up and he came to me and said ''look I really am feeling a bit tired, I'm not in my best form at the moment because I am feeling a bit tired''. 'So I said best thing is Adam Lallana starts the game and you rest and I have got you to bring on from the bench, simple as that. 'As you saw when he came on there is nothing wrong with him and he isn't suffering from anything. 'It was a question of having two players, who both did pretty well against San Marino and one is telling me he is a bit tired and jaded, the other one is full of beans. 'We'll put the one on who is full of beans and keep the other one up your sleeve. 'I think it would be wrong of players to try to fool me into think they are ready and that they're 100 per cent when they aren't because they are robbing somebody else of an opportunity. I thought Lallana had a good game.'"

         "Calls for every police officer to be offered a Taser to fight terrorist threat . Police Federation set to vote on giving all frontline officers training . Terrorist threat level for police was raised to severe after Paris attacks .",
         "Every frontline police officer should be offered a Taser to help fight the threat from lone-wolf terrorists, a police leader declared yesterday. Steve White, who chairs the Police Federation, said evidence of plans to murder officers made the move necessary. ‘The terrorist ideal to get attention no longer relies on an attack being in a place of note,’ he said. ‘It could be in Cheam high street, in any town, in any part of the UK. We know there are more dangerous people out there, preparing to attack police officers and we need to be able to respond to that threat.’ Steve White, who chairs the Police Federation, said evidence of plans to murder officers made it necessary for every frontline officer to be offered a taser . Leaders of the Police Federation are set to vote next month about whether every uniformed officer should be offered training in the use of a Taser . The terrorist threat level for police was raised to severe two weeks ago in the wake of the Paris atrocity and a foiled assault on officers in Belgium. Since then, police chiefs and junior officers have been considering how to counter the extra dangers. Last December, a threat was made to kidnap and kill a policeman in the West Midlands. Officers were given extra security briefings and urged not to travel to work in uniform. Leaders of the Police Federation, which represents rank-and-file officers, will vote next month on a proposal that every uniformed frontline officer should be offered training in the use of Tasers, though some may choose not to carry them. The weapons, which carry an electric current of up to 50,000 volts to incapacitate dangerous suspects, have been linked to at least ten deaths in England and Wales over the past decade. Some senior officers are believed to support the idea in theory, but one police leader said chief constables would be mostly opposed. The police chief, speaking anonymously, told the Guardian: ‘The idea of arming every police officer with a Taser is alien to 200 years of police culture. It is a stepping stone to arming the police – something strapped to your hip that looks like a firearm is a huge shift in what we stand for.’"

         "800 common pavement ants are now living on International Space Station . Scientists will examine how they work together in low gravity to find food . The ants' methods can then be copied to develop 'intelligent' search robots .",
         "By . Dan Bloom . It's one very, very small step for man - but a giant leap for antkind. Around 800 common ants, usually found pattering across pavements and picnics, have been sent to the International Space Station to teach scientists how they move in low gravity. Eight colonies each about the size of a tablet computer have been set up to teach experts how to build robots which interact with each other. Welcome: Nasa astronaut Rick Mastracchio greets 800 new friends aboard the International Space Station. Scientists will study how ants work together in low gravity and copy their methods to develop robots . Small steps: Each of the eight colonies is the size of a tablet computer and can be expanded to examine how the insects work together in different-sized environments . As the colonies are expanded, the ants move from small circles to straight lines to cover more ground . Houseguests: The colonies were delivered alongside Christmas presents for ISS astronauts . It is because ants inside colonies move according to internalised rules, judging how many other ants are nearby by touching antenna and using their sense of smell. Working together, the ants cover a piece of ground comprehensively to find food and supplies. When the area expands they change from moving in small circles to scuttling in straighter lines, covering more ground. But in the micro gravity of space, the ants' rules are confounded and they have to develop a new set of innate principles by which to work. These flexible principles could then be adapted to instruct robots to work together in the same way, for tasks like searching a burning building. Video cameras are trained on the experiment and images of the pavement ants, as they are known, are being beamed back to Earth. Close-up: The images will be beamed back to Earth. Pictured: Nasa flight engineer Mike Hopkins . Significant: The experiment could help develop robots which search disaster zones or burning buildings . These will be monitored by students at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas, and compared to a similar colony in their classroom. Stefanie Countryman, a professor at Bioserve Space Technologies, the private firm which launched the mission, told Bionews Texas: 'When ant densities are high, each ant thoroughly searches one small area in a circular, â€˜randomâ€™ walk. 'When ant densities are low, each ant searches by walking in a relatively straight line, allowing it to cover more ground.' The unusual cargo was delivered by an unmanned supply rocket this week which also included 28 mini-satellites known as Doves. Each less than 2ft across, they contain ultra high definition cameras which could track crop harvests, climate change and natural disasters like wildfires and floods. The cargo also included Christmas presents for those aboard the International Space Station - which were supposed to be delivered last month. The ants' launch had to be delayed several times after emergency repairs, America's 'polar vortex' of cold weather and a strong solar storm all intervened."

         "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- People in big cities walk past them every day -- street performers, or buskers. Some are talented, some are not, and most aren't performing for a cause greater than themselves. But on Monday, 12-year-old Abby Miller was. Abby Miller sings for her friend Taylor Love outside Washington's Union Station on Monday. She was performing outside Washington's Union Station to help her 4-year-old friend, Taylor Love, who is suffering from cancer. Abby sat in front of the station with a couple of her friends, singing songs and strumming a guitar. Passers-by seemed to notice the girl's singing talent, stopping to listen in the chilly weather, with a few putting money in a bucket at Abby's feet. Abby said the money will help support Taylor's family. A few more stopped to write messages on \"Love Notes,\" little cards designed to encourage Taylor Love through the tough time. \"Her mom reads them to her before she goes to bed at night,\" Abby said. \"Taylor gets excited for them and she loves getting them read to her because she likes knowing that people are supporting her and people are actually thinking of her.\" Taylor has neuroblastoma, a cancer that affects the nervous system. According to her Web site, she is in remission, but this type of cancer has a high risk of recurrence. There has been little research on the illness, of which there are about 650 new cases in the United States each year. Mike Gillette, a family friend of both Taylor and Abby, brought the two girls together. While raising money and support for Taylor is important, he said, he thinks Abby's outreach can help bring more critical awareness for the devastating disease. \"She really wanted to reach people all over the country,\" he said. Gillette said he has taken Abby to do similar performances in the District of Columbia, New Jersey and Virginia, and estimates they've raised thousands of dollars and have gotten people to write several hundred \"Love Notes.\" Abby does more than just raise money and awareness for her friend. Taylor's mother, Aimee, said that although Abby is eight years older than Taylor, the two see each other often and have a special connection that helps her get through her daughter's illness. \"I think it's amazing for a 12-year-old Abby to be drawn to my daughter, who is 4 and wants to inspire other children,\" Aimee Love said. \"The joy I see in Taylor when she sees Abby brings a light into my life.\" Taylor's family said her treatments are terribly painful. But Abby said Taylor has enormous character. \"She's the most happy girl in the world, which I think is just incredible,\" Abby said. \"She's so much fun to be around. She's a little 4-year-old girl but she's got a heart of like a thousand grown adults.\" Aimee Love said her daughter feels the same way about Abby. \"It gives her someone to aspire to, someone to be inspired by,\" she said."

         "Denise Shepherd, 19, who died from an overdose of heroin and a cocktail of pills after becoming addicted to drugs aged 11 . A teenage girl died from an overdose of heroin and a cocktail of pills after becoming addicted to drugs when she was aged just 11, an inquest has heard. Denise Shepherd started smoking cannabis before starting secondary school and then progressed to harder drugs such as heroin. In June last year, aged 19, she was found dead in the flat she shared with her boyfriend Jamie Hayne in Eastbourne, East Sussex, when he woke in the early hours of the morning and found she had stopped breathing. At an inquest into her death at Eastbourne Magistrate's Court, her mother Joann Bell told the coroner how her daughter had moved into her flat in a bid to get her to stop taking drugs but was later joined by Mr Hayne. The pair were said to be drinking heavily and were suspected of taking drugs. However, two days before Miss Shepherd, who was unemployed, was found dead, Ms Bell moved out of the flat. She said her daughter and Mr Hayne had a volatile relationship and didn't clean up after themselves. She said: 'They became increasingly difficult to live with. 'I struggled financially because they came to me for food.' She also told the hearing how her daughter had smoked cannabis from a very early age after she had 'fallen in with the wrong crowd'. Coronor Alan Craze was also told how a neighbour had tried to administer CPR to Miss Shepherd when she was discovered unconscious. When paramedics arrived they too were unable to revive her and it is feared she may have been dead for some time. Mr Craze then recorded a verdict of death due to a dependence on drugs. The inquest at Eastbourne Magistrates Court, pictured, saw Coroner Alan Craze record a verdict of death due to a dependence on drugs . Speaking after the inquest, Ms Bell said she has tried to warn her daughter about the dangers of drugs. She said: 'It is so difficult. People won’t talk to their parents about drugs. 'I tried to sit down and talk to her calmly but I never was aware exactly what was going on. 'I wouldn’t have moved out if I had known. 'She was gullible, naive and easily-led. 'She would be an aunty now. Her brother is now a father. She would have loved being an aunty.'"

         "Corning unveils a new, thinner form of its popular Gorilla Glass at CES . The original Gorilla Glass is used in more than 500 models of touchscreen gadgets . New glass more responsive but not less resistant to breakage than current Gorilla Glass .",
         "Las Vegas (CNN) -- The makers of Gorilla Glass, the glass that's used in touchscreen gadgets such as iPhones, iPads and more than 500 other models of electronic gadgets, has officially unveiled a thinner and more touch-sensitive version of their product. When it comes to innovation in electronic gadgets, a new kind of glass is not especially sexy. But when that glass is built into millions of touchscreen devices, and could potentially make them thinner, lighter and more responsive to your finger, consumers may take notice. Corning Inc. says Gorilla Glass 2 is thinner and more touch-sensitive without sacrificing toughness or resistance to scratches. The company showed off the glass Monday at a gadget-showcase event at the International Consumer Electronics Show here and is showing live demos of its enhanced qualities at the Corning booth throughout the four-day show. The new glass is not any less resistant to breakage than the current Gorilla Glass, which may be disappointing news to anyone who has had to put up with a cracked screen after dropping a phone. \"It's not scratch-proof. And if they drop it on granite, it can be broken,\" said Corning general manager Clifford Hund. But he added that Corning has managed to make the glass 20% thinner but just as strong -- a key advancement at a time when smartphone and tablet makers are trying to produce ever-thinner devices. The second generation of Gorilla Glass will debut in Windows-based PCs this year. Other manufacturers also are weighing how and when to add the glass to their upcoming devices, Hund said. Because it's thinner -- about 0.8 millimeters instead of 1 millimeter -- the glass allows users' fingers to be closer to the touch interface, creating a screen that responds more quickly and accurately, said Gorilla Glass program director Jaymin Amin. The glass also has been engineered to let more light through, creating a brighter display screen, Corning executives said. Due to customer nondisclosure agreements, Corning cannot name all the devices that use Gorilla Glass -- including Apple products. But according to multiple other sources, including Walter Isaacson's recent biography of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, the product's first consumer application was the original iPhone in 2007. A passage from Isaacson's book details how Apple had originally planned to use plastic display coverings for its iPhone before Jobs approached Corning CEO Wendell Weeks about ordering glass instead. Weeks told him Corning had developed a tough form of glass, made extra strong by a chemical process, but couldn't find a market for it. Weeks didn't think Corning could manufacture the glass fast enough to meet Apple's timetable for the iPhone launch. But at the prodding of Jobs, who wouldn't take no for an answer, Corning did it in six months. After the iPhone hit the market, Jobs sent Weeks a note that said, \"We couldn't have done it without you.\" Gorilla Glass also is part of touchscreens in electronic devices by Acer, Asus, Dell, HTC, LG, Motorola, Nokia, Samsung and Sony, among other manufacturers. Amin demonstrated its toughness Monday by placing a small square of the original glass in a lever press, then applying more than 100 pounds of pressure onto it. Despite looking like he was truly exerting himself, he couldn't break it. Amin then tested the new glass the same way and got the same result."

         "(CNN)The Red Bull Formula One team has had its trophy cabinet cleared out by thieves in a smash-and-grab burglary Friday night. The British-based marque has won 50 grands prix, four constructor titles and four drivers' world championships in its 10-year history. The spoils of this success had been on display in the reception to its factory, which is based on an industrial estate in Milton Keynes, England. \"We are obviously devastated by this serious factory break-in, which saw offenders drive a vehicle through our front entrance and steal more than 60 trophies which took years and hard work to accumulate,\" Red Bull team principal Christian Horner said in a statement. \"The break in caused significant damage and was very upsetting for our night officers who were on duty at the time. \"Beyond the aggressive nature of this break in, we are perplexed why anyone would take these trophies. \"The value to the team is of course extraordinarily high due to the sheer hard work and effort that went into winning each and every one. But their intrinsic value is low; they would be of little benefit to those outside of the team and, in addition to that, many of the trophies on display were replicas.\" Smash and grab . Thames Valley Police are investigating the incident which took place just before 01:30 Friday. A statement by the police, who are appealing for witnesses, detailed the robbery was carried out by around six men. \"Two cars were involved in the burglary,\" the statement added. \"A silver 4x4 which was used to drive through the entrance and a further dark colored, black or dark blue Mercedes estate car. Both are believed to have foreign number plates.\" Red Bull said it would be review access to its factory following the incident. The team has a reputation as one of the most open in the secretive world of F1."

         "Los Angeles (CNN) -- \"Teflon Don\" rapper Rick Ross crashed his silver Rolls Royce into an apartment building after he heard gunfire along a Fort Lauderdale, Florida, street Monday morning, police said. \"The driver of the Rolls Royce attempted to drive away from the direction of the shots being fired and lost control of the vehicle, striking a nearby apartment building,\" Fort Lauderdale Police Detective DeAnna Garcia said. Ross and a female passenger were not hurt by the wreck or the gunshots, Garcia said. \"The suspects fled from the area prior to police arrival,\" she said. The incident, however, called attention to threats against the artist's life made in a street gang's videos and posted online in recent months. \"We're pulling up on you,\" a man who identified himself as a member of the Gangster Disciples warned in one of the videos. \"Whatever city, whatever state, the pressure on.\" Several videos purporting to be from Gangster Disciple members in several states -- including Georgia, North Carolina and Florida -- appeared on YouTube late last year demanding that Ross pay a fee to them for his use of the Star of David, which they claim as a gang symbol, and a reference to one of their founders in his music and marketing. \"You got to cut the check,\" one video said. \"Tell your boss man he got to get that check, or all you in trouble.\" \"We need that cash right now,\" another said. Ross, 37, whose albums include \"Teflon Don\" in 2010 and \"Deeper Than Rap\" a year earlier, told south Florida radio station 99 Jamz last month that he was not intimidated by the threats. \"Ain't never no checks getting cut,\" he said. \"I don't play those games. I consider that extortion.\" Is Nas hip-hop's finest MC? Ross did cancel his North Carolina shows last month just days after a video appeared online threatening his life if he performed there. \"Never was it due to any threats,\" he told the radio station. Instead, he canceled because \"the promoter wasn't really handling his business.\" Ross wanted to make certain that listeners understood he was not frightened. \"Don't ever get it twisted, Ricky Ross is the boss,\" he said. The death threats are not the only challenge to Ross. A former drug lord and gang leader is suing in a Los Angeles court, accusing him of stealing his name and reputation. \"The reality is I want justice done,\" the original Ross wrote in an e-mail to CNN. \"I know that he took his name and image from my life and believe he is unfairly profiting off my story.\" Ricky \"Freeway\" Ross was serving a prison sentence a decade ago when rapper William Roberts, who previously worked as a Florida correctional officer, adopted \"Rick Ross\" as his stage name, according to the lawsuit. \"This rapper and his labels clearly knew of my name and story, and have tried to suck out the lifeblood without license,\" the former drug lord said. \"I have my own use for my intellectual property and did not need this confusion created.\" More recently, the rapper has been using the name \"Ricky Rozay.\" The rapper and his record label have not responded to CNN's request for comment. Despite the death threats and legal issues, his music is doing well. Ross is nominated for a best rap album Grammy for his latest release, \"God Forgives, I Don't.\" CNN's Marlena Baldacci contributed to this report."

         "LIKE James Bond, Sir Roger Moore has at times enjoyed a martini. But the actor has revealed he can no longer drink the cocktail because of his Type 2 diabetes. Sir Roger, 86, was diagnosed with the condition last year, and it means he has to watch the amount of sugar and alcohol he consumes. A martini is a highly alcoholic cocktail, made from a combination of gin and vermouth. And it was Bond’s drink of choice when Sean Connery played the spy. Shaken not stirred: Sir Roger Moore, who starred in seven James Bond films, drinks a martini in 1968 . Opening up about his health condition, Sir Roger said: ‘I make a very good dry martini but I’m not allowed to drink them any more. No more sugar, no alcohol. I get to taste the wine and I can make a little sip last an hour. I enjoy it much more. I remember a lot more of what happened.’ Typically a martini is a gin-based drink, although it can also be made with vodka. In the 007 films Bond is known for ordering his martinis ‘shaken not stirred’, referring to the way in which they are made. The cocktail can also be made ‘with a twist’, which involves lemon peel, or ‘dirty’, where it contains olive brine. It was Connery’s Bond who drank martinis, Sir Roger explained, first uttering the ‘shaken not stirred’ catchphrase in Goldfinger. Sir Roger (pictured in 2013) was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes last year and can no longer drink martinis . In the past Sir Roger has admitted having a taste for champagne. These days, however, he sticks to soft drinks, claiming his ‘vice’ to be Diet Coke. And he has come up a guilt-free virgin cocktail – a Band Aid – which is a combination of non-alcoholic beer and Diet Coke. ‘No calories and it’s delicious,’ Sir Roger said. Giving an interview to the Sunday Telegraph the actor, who starred in seven James Bond films, went on to joke that he would indulge in martinis and ice cream if he knew he only had one day left to live. He said: ‘When I’m told I’ve got 24 hours to go, I’m going to have a couple of dry martinis with Tanqueray gin - not vodka - and a couple of choc ices with plain chocolate on the outside and white, white vanilla on the inside - oh, and baked beans.’ Sir Roger, who last appeared as 007 almost 30 years ago, revealed he had been diagnosed with diabetes last year. He had collapsed at home in Monaco and been rushed into hospital by his fourth wife Kristina Tholstrup. Doctors confirmed that the star, who had been losing weight for some time, was suffering from the condition. Appearing on US TV’s Late Show with David Letterman ‘I went to the doctor, and he said, “You know those high blood-sugar numbers you’ve been dealing with since you were 36? Well, you’ve graduated! You’ve got Type 2 diabetes, young man”.’ In the past Sir Roger has survived prostate cancer and had a pacemaker inserted."

         "Scientists are developing a laser that could kill millions of mosquitoes in minutes . The system has been developed to tackle the spread of malaria . Around one million people die of malaria each year, according to the WHO .",
         "LONDON, England -- Scientists in the U.S. are developing a laser gun that could kill millions of mosquitoes in minutes. The WHO has reported that around half of the world's population is at risk of malaria. The laser, which has been dubbed a \"weapon of mosquito destruction\" fires at mosquitoes once it detects the audio frequency created by the beating of its wings. The laser beam then destroys the mosquito, burning it on the spot. Developed by some of the astrophysicists involved in what was known as the \"Star Wars\" anti-missile programs during the Cold War, the project is meant to prevent the spread of malaria. Lead scientist on the project, Dr. Jordin Kare, told CNN that the laser would be able to sweep an area and \"toast millions of mosquitoes in a few minutes.\" Malaria is a life-threatening disease caused by parasites that are transmitted to people from the bites of female mosquitoes. It is particularly prevalent in tropical and sub-tropical regions of the world and kills an African child every 30 seconds, according to the World Health Organization. There are an estimated 300 million acute cases of malaria each year globally, resulting in more than one million deaths, the WHO reports. Responding to questions about any potential harm the laser could pose to the eco-system, Kare said: \"There is no such thing as a good mosquito, there's nothing that feeds exclusively on them. No one would miss mosquitoes,\" he said. \"In any case,\" he added. \"The laser is able to distinguish between mosquitoes that go after people and those that aren't dangerous. What remains to be seen is how precise we can get.\" He added that other insects would not be affected by the laser's beam. Kare said the lasers could be mounted on lamp post-type poles and put around the circumference of villages, to create a kind of \"fence\" against mosquitoes. The research was commissioned by Intellectual Ventures, a Washington, U.S.-based company that was founded by Nathan Myhrvold, a former Microsoft Corporation executive. His previous boss, Bill Gates, who funded the research, asked Myhrvold to look into new ways of combating malaria."

Both Pineda and Davis said it was pine tar. 'When . it's that obvious, something has got to be said,' Farrell explained . after the game. 'Our awareness was heightened, given what we had seen in . the past.' The ejection also set off a debate in the baseball world about pitchers who use pine tar, and whether it should be allowed in certain circumstances. Many former aces said they had done it, albeit in a more discreet manner. Rule 8.02(b) prohibits pitchers from altering the ball to gain an unfair advantage, and forbids them from having a foreign substance on them or in their possession on the mound. Pineda wasn't seen with the pine tar in the first inning, when the Red Sox roughed him up. Boston manager John Farrell asked plate umpire Gerry Davis to check Pineda after two fast outs the next inning. Got ya: Umpire Gerry Davis determined that the substance on Pineda's neck was pine tar, which is against the rules for pitchers . Earlier . this month, Pineda pitched well against the Red Sox at Yankee Stadium. Television cameras showed a substance on his hand during that outing â€” Pineda said it was dirt, not pine tar. Among . other suspensions of pitchers for pine tar in the past decade, Tampa . Bay's Joel Peralta was penalized eight games in 2012, the Angels' Brendan Donnelly 10 days in 2005 and St. Louis' Julian Tavarez 10 days . in 2004. The suspensions of Donnelly and Tavarez were cut to eight days . after they asked the players' association to appeal, and Peralta dropped . his challenge with no reduction. Yankees general manager Brian Cashman said Pineda and the organization were 'embarrassed.' Yankees manager Joe Girardi called it 'an error in judgment' and a 'little bump' and 'poor judgment.' 'He had a hard time gripping the baseball. Unknown to us, he put it on and went out there,' Girardi said. 'It's a young kid. I don't think he's trying to do anything, cheat. I think he's just trying to go out there and compete.' Obvious: Boston manager John Farrell said that when it's as obvious as it was on Pineda, he has to alert the umpires . In Pineda's previous start against the Red Sox, a 4-1 Yankees win in New York on April 10, television cameras caught Pineda with what appeared to be sticky pine tar on his hand on a cool night. Farrell didn't see a photograph of Pineda's hand until the fourth inning; when Pineda came out to warm up for the fifth, his hand was clean. Pineda said the dark substance was dirt but it sparked debate about pitchers' use of sticky substances to get a better grip on cool nights. On Wednesday, with the game time temperature at 50 degrees, Sizemore started the first with a triple and scored on Dustin Pedroia's single. With one out, Mike Napoli singled Pedroia to third. After Mike Carp flied to left, A.J. Pierzynski singled up the middle, scoring Pedroia. After Pineda's ejection, David Phelps came in and completed the strikeout of Sizemore. Trend: A similar brown, sticky substance was seen on Pineda's hand in another game against Boston on April 10 . John Lackey (3-2) allowed one run and seven hits in eight innings with 11 strikeouts and no walks. Koji Uehara struck out three in the ninth in a non-save situation. The previous time Lackey faced the Yankees he allowed four homers in a 7-2 loss on April 12. On Wednesday, he struck out the side in the third then had two strikeouts in each of the next two innings. Mike Napoli had three hits and Boston scored two runs in the first and two more in the third. The Yankees scored on Alfonso Soriano's sacrifice fly in the sixth."

Police found Dr. Jorge Mario Gonzalez shot to death and a ranch worker badly injured . Gonzalez's wife and toddler found unharmed; they reportedly hid in a closet .",
         "(CNN) -- Four suspects are sought in connection with the shooting death over the weekend of a Houston, Texas, doctor, Austin County authorities said Monday. Dr. Jorge Mario Gonzales was found shot to death at his ranch in rural Texas on Saturday, police say. Dr. Jorge Mario Gonzalez, 56, was chief of the critical care section at Houston's Methodist Hospital and \"a pulmonary medicine leader,\" according to the hospital system's Web site. He was found dead Saturday when deputies responded to a 911 call of a burglary in progress shortly after noon, said Austin County Sheriff's Office spokesman Sgt. Paul Faircloth. The responding officer was met by vehicles leaving the location, Faircloth said, and a person in one vehicle fired on the officer. The officer and his car were not struck, and the officer did not return fire, Faircloth said. The officer was able to provide a detailed description of the vehicles, he said. At the home, which Faircloth said is in a rural, wooded and isolated area, officers found Gonzalez shot to death and another person wounded. The second victim was airlifted to an Austin, Texas, hospital. Watch Dr. Gonzalez's son talk about his father » . Gonzalez's wife and small child were found unharmed inside the home, Faircloth said. CNN affiliate KHOU identified the woman as Charleen Gonzalez, 29, and the couple's 2-year-old son, and reported the two hid in a closet. Authorities do not know whether the incident was a burglary or an intended home invasion, Faircloth said, and \"we do not know if this is random or targeted.\" Several leads were being followed Monday morning, he said, and numerous agencies were involved in the investigation. The motive for the killing had not been determined on Monday. The slaying took place at Gonzalez's ranch outside Bellville, Texas, said Lisa Block, spokeswoman for the Texas Department of Public Safety. Gonzalez, his wife and child arrived at the ranch about 11 a.m. Saturday, she said, and \"the suspects were at the house when they arrived.\" Gonzalez's wife ran inside with the child and called 911, she said. Ranch worker Noel Galvan was the second victim, Block said. He was listed in critical condition, she said. Faircloth said earlier Monday five suspects were being sought, but later said police were seeking four. The vehicles seen leaving the home were a late '90s white Ford F-150 pickup, occupied by two Hispanic males, Faircloth said, and a red Honda or Acura with dark tinted windows sitting low to the ground, with one Hispanic male inside. The shots were fired from the white pickup, he said. Another vehicle mentioned earlier Monday was a two-toned silver and black Ford F-150 that had two Hispanic males inside. Faircloth said Monday afternoon that vehicle had been located and was not thought to be involved. However, police released a video of a gray Lexus on Monday, and would like to question its owners, Faircloth said. The drivers are believed to be an older couple. The car was seen before the officer encountered the white and red vehicles. \"The manhunt continues on the ground,\" Faircloth said. The suspects are considered armed and dangerous, he said. Faircloth said he had no information on whether the home had surveillance equipment. Family members told KHOU that Gonzalez went to the ranch nearly every weekend. \"It's deeply saddening for all of us,\" an older son of Gonzalez, Juan Mauricio Gonzalez, told KHOU. \"We are a tight-knit family and he was just a perfect man, a perfect father and a great physician.\" The Methodist Hospital System said Gonzalez will be missed, \"both as a friend and an outstanding clinician and researcher. Our prayers and thoughts go out to his family during this tragedy.\" \"This man had nothing to do with anybody,\" Juan Gonzalez told KHOU. \"He was a peaceful man. He was a wise man. He was just here to make people better and nothing else.\" A reward totaling $26,000 was offered for information in the case leading to an arrest. CNN's Melanie Whitley contributed to this report."

         "By . Mail On Sunday Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 16:55 EST, 9 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 20:45 EST, 9 November 2013 . Sir Bob Russell MP offered a two-hour tour around his constituency town of Colchester - but it had no bids on eBay . A walking tour of Britain’s oldest recorded Roman town hosted by an MP has failed to attract any bids in an eBay auction. The two-hour tour of Colchester, Essex, was to be led by Lib Dem Sir Bob Russell around the ‘significant places’ of his life. Part of the East of England Lib Dems’ fundraising efforts, the tour was listed on eBay with a starting price of £40 – but Sir Bob was left red-faced after it failed to attract any bids despite being on offer for a week. The ‘Rome around Colchester’, for one or two people, included high tea in the Castle Park Cafe. The MP, who leads a free walk every New Year's Day, was tight-lipped about where he would escort the winning bidder as part of the tour. The former councillor and Mayor of Colchester, elected to Parliament in 1997, said: 'We do not . get money from big business or trades union to fund our elections - . money is raised by members and supporters.' The sale was one lot in a supposed 'Amazing Autumn Auction' by the East of England Liberal Democrats to raise funds for their European election campaign. But only one item sold as part of the event: a guided tour of St Alban's Abbey by Sandy Walkington, the party's prospective parliamentary candidate for St Albans. The anonymous buyer paid £20 for the experience and described it as 'very good'. Colchester, then called Camulodunum, was a key stronghold in the empire of Ancient Rome. In AD41 it was the subject of a fierce battle to control Britain by the Roman emperor Claudius. In 2005 archeologists unearthed the remains of a walled structure more than 1,000ft long which was believed to be a Roman circus or chariot racing arena. One of several Roman finds in the city, it was the only verified example of a Roman circus in Britain. Colchester Castle, Essex, one of the many historic sites which would have delighted visitors on Sir Bob's tour ."

         "Amir Khan back in UK after win over Devon Alexander in Las Vegas last Saturday . Welterweight boxer wants to fight Floyd Mayweather next and has accused him of running scared . Khan will donate his £30,000 shorts to charity to help raise funds for school attacked by Taliban . Read: Amir Khan heading for greatness after emphatic victory .",
         "Amir Khan has hit back at insults from America’s flamboyant world champion Floyd Mayweather by claiming he is more famous than the welterweight known as the best pound-for-pound fighter on the planet. And in a neat dig at Mayweather’s famed macho ego, Khan insisted he throws more punches in one round than the unbeaten world champion manages in an entire fight. Mayweather, who has earned £300million in a unbeaten 47-fight career, is looking for a super-fight with Manny Pacquiao and dismissed Khan’s plea to fight him by claiming the Bolton fighter’s ‘name doesn’t carry enough weight’. Amir Khan has announced that he will donate the £30,000 shorts he wore during his last week to charity . Khan posted two pictures of his refurbished gym and clothes from his fight with Devon Alexander on Thursday . But Khan, back in his native North West after beating Devon Alexander in Las Vegas at the weekend, was in fighting form as he held court at The Gloves Community Centre boxing gym in his hometown. ‘Mayweather says I’m not a big enough name but I am a bigger name than his opponents Maidana, Guerrero and Victor Ortiz put together. ‘I am known in places like India, Pakistan, Dubai and the UAE where they don’t even know who Mayweather is. India has a billion people, Pakistan has 180m people and I can’t even walk down the street there. I am bigger than Mayweather in a lot of places and I can help him become more famous, and earn more money.’ Khan isn’t worried that 36-year-old Mayweather could catch him out. Khan was all smiles as he talked to the assembled press at his gym in Bolton . Khan is hoping his next fight will be against Floyd Mayweather next year . ‘Mayweather throws maybe three hundred punches in a fight, I could manage that in a single round,’ he said. ‘Floyd will never hurt me. I have been knocked down in other fights but Mayweather is not the biggest puncher, not as big as Alexander. Our fight would be like a game of chess, hit-move. It would be about footwork and accuracy, nothing more, nothing less. ‘I speak to legends like Roy Jones and Thomas Hearns and they say I would beat him. Even the taxi driver I spoke to in Vegas said he hoped I would knock him out. The people there want to see him humbled . ‘But Floyd is the boss. If he doesn’t want to fight me, he won’t. He’s not the type of guy where I could just turn up to his house and have a chat about it. But maybe all this stuff about me not being a big name is a sign he might be interested, he is starting to promote the fight. I don’t think him and Pacquiao will happen.’ Khan’s homecoming to England after wowing the Vegas fans has been bittersweet. His friend Anthony Crolla, who trains in the same gym, suffered a fractured skull and broken ankle after being hit on the head by a concrete slab as he confronted burglars. Khan lands a left hand during his impressive win on decision against Alexander . Khan arrived back in Manchester along with his wife and daughter on Wednesday . Mayweather says Khan's 'name holds no weight' and that he will not fight him . And the terrorist attack that killed 132 schoolchildren in Pakistan, where Khan’s family originate from, has also affected him badly. The £30,000 pair of shorts he wore at the weekend, containing a gold waistband, will be auctioned off to raise funds for the survivors. Talking about Crolla, Khan revealed that he had volunteered to be his pal’s sparring partner ahead of his world lightweight title shot against Richar Abril in Manchester on January 23, which has now been cancelled . ‘Me and Crolla are good friends,’ said Khan. ‘I roomed with him as an amateur. ‘His trainer Joe Gallagher was at my fight in Vegas and I told him I would spar with Crollar to help him because Abril is a long fighter, and I have got long arms, I can replicate his style. It is probable that Mayweather will insist on fighting Pacquiao, an eight-division champion, in his adopted hometown of Las Vegas . FLOYD MAYWEATHER . Age 37 . Born Michigan, USA . Professional debut October 11, 1996 . Fights 47 . Wins 47 . Knockouts 26 . Losses 0 . Draws 0 . MANNY PACQUIAO . Age 36 . Born Bukidnon, Phillipines . Professional debut January 22, 1995 .

Draws 0 . ‘Then I got back and found he had been smashed over the head. I feel really bad, they have taken away his dream of fighting for a world title and tried to ruin his life, over nothing.’ Khan admits there must be doubts over whether Crolla can fight again. ‘When you have suffered something that bad, you have to understand the Board might not give him a license. It is very dangerous, is it worth that risk? ‘We fighters, even me in his position, would want to fight again, but sometimes you have to think of your health first.’ The attack on Crolla follows a knife attack on another potential Khan opponent, Kell Brook, in Tenerife earlier this year. The two incidents were totally unconnected but Khan says he is always conscious of trying to stay away from trouble outside boxing. ‘I don’t like fighting, I only do it when I am in the ring,’ he said."

         "A film starring Diogo Morgado as Jesus opens this week . Carol Costello says he inspired the hashtag \"HotJesus\" Costello: Is physical attractiveness necessary for a religious figure in today's culture?",
         "Clearly Jesus was sexy. After all, He is the Son of God. I don't mean to be disrespectful, but as I watched the trailer for the new movie, \"Son of God,\" I found myself gawking at the actor portraying Jesus. Diogo Morgado is one hot dude. His Jesus looks more like Brad Pitt than that nice man with the beard in all those paintings. I'm not the only one gawking at Morgodo's Jesus. He inspired the hashtag, \"#HotJesus\". It went viral on Twitter. The actor told The New York Times he doesn't want his looks to distract from the movie, but, \"If the message of Jesus was love, hope and compassion, and I can bring that to more people by being a more appealing Jesus, I am happy with that.\" Clearly we have a new trend. A \"more appealing\" Jesus is not just a better prophet, he's ... sexy. We actually don't know what Jesus looked like. We do know he was a carpenter, so perhaps Jesus was buff. But, I don't think when the Biblical Nathaniel asked, \"Nazareth! Can anything good come from there?\" and Phillip answered, \"Come and see,\" they were talking about Jesus' beautiful face or chiseled abs. Yes, Jesus, as portrayed in countless paintings, has a six-pack. As comedian and author, Greg Behrendt joked, \"I'd like to get ripped ... ripped like Jesus. Jesus was ripped. You've seen the pictures, right? He's ripped! Ripped. He's the son of God. He's not going to be walking around saying I've got back fat today, I'm so puffy.\" All joking aside, why must Jesus be sexy? Or ripped? Or even handsome? The Rev. Robert B. Lawton, SJ, a Jesuit priest and former president of Loyola Marymount University, says, \"There is absolutely no indication that Jesus was good-looking and sexy. In fact there is a passage in the prophet Isaiah that is taken as referring to Jesus. It says this: . \"He had no form or majesty that we should look at him/nothing in his appearance that we should desire him. He was despised and rejected by others; a man of suffering and acquainted with infirmity; and as one from whom others hide their faces he was despised, and we held him of no account.\" (Isaiah 53. 2-3.) While this might not be conclusive evidence, it's quite possible that Jesus was no Jewish Brad Pitt from Palestine. On the other hand, why wouldn't God create a perfect Son? \"Anything that is sexy is going to attract people. People who might not go to the movie might want to check it out, particularly non-Christians,\" says the Rev. Lisa Jenkins, senior pastor of St. Matthew's Baptist Church in Harlem. \"I don't see a problem with Jesus being attractive given our cultural context,\" she says. \"I don't recall a Jesus who was not appealing to the eye. That's Hollywood.\" Jenkins is more concerned about what she considers an inaccurate portrayal of Jesus' ethnicity. The Rev. James Martin, SJ, editor-at-large for America Magazine, and author of the coming book, \"Jesus: A Pilgrimage,\" agrees. \"God did not choose to incarnate himself in Laguna Beach,\" he says. \"He chose to incarnate Himself at a certain place, at a certain time in a certain person.\" And that person was a Palestinian Jew. \"Many people have a hard time with the humanity of Jesus ... the closer He is to human physical perfection, the easier it is for some to accept Him.\" But, Martin says, there is a danger in that too. A physically perfect Jesus makes Him into a God pretending to be man. When Jesus was both human and divine. \"He was like us in all things, except sin, as the theology goes,\" Martin says. \"That means, He had a body, He got sick, He got tired, He may have sprained an ankle or two. There are passages in the Gospel showing Him falling asleep because He was tired. We tend to airbrush the physical imperfections away.\" Those traits make Jesus so much more accessible. So much more ... human. I tried to come up with a living person to compare to Jesus. That, of course, is impossible. The closest I can come, as a Catholic, is Pope Francis. I've grown to revere him. Is it because he's sexy? In a word: No."

         "New York couple happy for four years of marriage until recession saw husband give up his apartment and move in to hers .",
         "By . Rachel Quigley . Last updated at 6:52 PM on 10th July 2011 . Theirs is more than just your average boy-meets-girl story. It's a New York love story, with a very modern twist. Allen Sheinman, 58, and his wife Collette Stallone, 56, said they know the secret to a happy and successful marriage - live in separate homes. For the first four years of wedded bliss the quirky couple - who met online - lived apart, she in Greenwich Village and he in West 23rd street in Manhattan. Secret: Collette Stallone said she believes marriage is a state of mind and doesn't see why two people have to live together . Force: Allen Sheinman said he didn't want to both get married and lived together but the recession drove them to cohabit . Allen - a managing editor at a trade publication - said: 'We consider seventh avenue a long hallway between our two domiciles.' But hard times hit as it did with many New Yorkers and when Allen's boss raised his rent to $1,800 a month, the couple did the unthinkable - they moved in together. Allen said: 'It was really a financial move to cohabit. Now we are transitioning into real-time marriage. This is it.' Speaking about living together - or not living together - Allen said it was an arrangement they were both comfortable with. He said: 'I told her I could handle getting married and living together, just not both. And to my relief she said, \"OK let's get married and keep our own places\". That's what I was hoping for.' Colette said: 'When you're young you think, \"Oh, . we’re in love,\" all that. But when you get older, you say, \"You know, I . love you, but I need my space\".' Expensive: Allen leaves his spacious apartment on West 23rd street because the rent was increased to $1,800 . Tight squeeze: There is barely room for Collette's stuff in her Greenwich Village apartment nevermind her husbands . When Allen moved into Colette's tiny one-bedroom Greenwich Village apartment, where she has been for 31 years, even then they weren't prepared to fully live together. Instead of embracing cohabitation, the couple drew up battle lines, put up invisible walls and lay down a set of ground rules. According to the New York Post, there was no crossing into each other's space without permission, she had her own bedroom - where she generously said he could sleep at weekends - and he slept in a sofa bed in the living room. The end?: The couple are still blissfully in love after four years of marriage and living apart but will cohabiting change that? They have their own newspaper and magazine subscriptions,' watch their own TV shows from their own space and even have a shower rota. The kitchen - which also hosts the apartment's only shower - is the only place that is allowed for both couples any time of the day or night. Colette - a retired high-school teacher who now runs her home-made jewellery business - believes that not living together was the secret to their happy marriage. 'Getting married is a state of mind, I don't see why we have to live together. I don't need to see him brush his teeth,' she told the Post. 'It's bad enough I see him brush his hair. 'I don’t know where this idea came from that you always have to be in the middle of whatever the other person is doing.' Alarmingly, she said when she told her ex-husband they were now living together he said: 'I give it four months.' The couple are featured in a documentary titled 'Two's a crowd' which will have its New York premiere at the Rooftop Films Summer Series on July 21."

Food businesses or importers will need to label products correctly . If sweeteners are added, the label should read 'blend of sugar and honey'",
         "By . Associated Press . and Reuters . Honey mixed with sugar might be sweet, but it is not 'honey.' The Food and Drug Administration is taking steps to ensure that shoppers who buy honey are getting the real deal. New guidance issued Tuesday would prevent food companies from adding sugar or other sweeteners to pure honey and still calling it 'honey.' Funny honey: The Food and Drug Administration is taking steps to ensure that shoppers who buy honey are getting the real deal . The agency said enforcement action is possible against U.S. food businesses or importers if companies try to cut those sweeteners into real honey and do not label the product correctly. If those sweeteners are added, the label should read 'blend of sugar and honey' or 'blend of honey and corn syrup.' The FDA regularly detains honey imports and tests them after finding drug residues and unlabeled added sweeteners. Only manufactures that do not add sugar, corn syrup or other sweeteners should label their products as pure 'honey,' the FDA said in draft guidelines posted online. The proposal aims 'to advise the regulated food industry on the proper labeling of honey and honey products to help ensure that honey and honey products are not adulterated or misbranded,' the agency wrote. Americans consume more than 400 million pounds of honey each year, according to U.S. government and industry estimates. New rules: The guidance, released Tuesday, would stop food companies from putting sugar or other sweeteners into pure honey and still referring to it as honey . But just 149 million pounds were produced in the United States last year, U.S. Department of Agriculture data showed. To feed America's sweet tooth, much honey is imported, and U.S. producers are worried about cheap substitutes. Pure honey is generally more expensive than those mixed with corn syrup and traditional sugar, and prices reached a record high of $2.12 a pound last year, according to the USDA. The FDA's review follows a petition from the American Beekeeping Federation and several other related groups seeking a standard U.S. definition for the natural sweetener to promote fair trade.While the agency rejected their request, it said it was willing to look at labeling. Sticky situation: If sweeteners are added, the label should read 'blend of sugar and honey' or 'blend of honey and corn syrup' The FDA inspected imported honey to see whether it had been 'adulterated' with corn or cane sugars. In recent decades, it detained honey containing such substitutes from countries such as Brazil and Mexico, according to the agency. Manufacturers have 60 days to comment on the proposal before final guidelines are issued. Even then, however, guidelines are not mandatory."

         "By . Lizzie Edmonds . William Henry Welch, 53, escaped punishment for driving without licence because his wife incorrectly told him he would be covered if he borrowed a friend's car . A star of My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding escaped punishment for driving without insurance after his wife checked his documentation as he can 'barely read', a court heard. William Henry Welch, 53, avoided six penalty points on his driving licence because his wife incorrectly told him he would be covered if he borrowed a friend's car, a court was told. Welch told Magistrates he asked his wife to look at his documents as he struggles with reading. He was granted an absolute discharge after admitting driving without insurance at Newton Aycliffe Magistrates' Court. Welch is a well-known campaigner for traveller and gipsy rights - and has appeared on My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding among other reality shows. Speaking after the case Welch said: 'It isn’t all doom and gloom when you go to these courts, if you go and you have a reasonable argument the magistrates are willing to listen. 'You should never just give up and think that they won’t listen to you because they will.' The court heard how Welch’s own car had broken down when he was working in Leominster, Herefordshire, and a friend loaned him a Vauxhall Vectra to drive back home. Welch told the court he had rung his wife, Rachel, to check he was covered to drive the Vectra. After reading the insurance policy she told him that he was. Welch of Darlington, Durham, told the court he left insurance documents to his wife because: 'I can barely read.' Mrs Welch, 49, told the court: 'We were both named on the insurance document and so I thought we were both policy holders.' Andrea Milson, prosecuting, told the court that as policyholder, Mrs Welch was covered to drive any car. However, as Mr Welch was a named driver he was only covered to drive the family car and not the borrowed Vectra. Welch, a well-known Gypsy campaigner, told the court he asked his wife to look at his documentation as he can 'barely read'. He has starred in numerous television shows including My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding . The car was stopped by police on the A456 in Worcestershire last August and Welch was subsequently charged with driving with no insurance and no MoT. Welch admitted both charges but, in a rare ‘special reasons hearing’, his solicitor, David Dedman, argued that the licence should not be endorsed with the usual six penalty points. 'This was an honest mistake,' said Mr Dedman. 'He genuinely believed he was insured and was misled by his wife, not deliberately or intentionally.' Magistrates granted Welch an absolute discharge on the matter of no insurance. They imposed no penalty points, but he was ordered to pay costs of £85. He was fined a further £100 for the offence of driving a vehicle with no MoT test certificate. Paddy Doherty walked free from court after headbutting his stepbrother in March . In March, Paddy Doherty, 55, walked free from court after admitting he headbutted his stepbrother. The 55-year-old breached the terms of a suspended jail sentence when he committed the assault at a pub in Flintshire, north Wales, in October 2013. He was given a six-month supervision order instead of jail time. The 2011 winner of Celebrity Big Brother had previously been handed a 31-week jail term, suspended for two years, in January 2012, after he brawled in the street with a fellow traveller. The show's infamous dressmaker Thelma Madine was sued by her head designer for unfair dismissal at the end of 2013. A court ruled Ms Madine dismissed Leanne Phillips, who was paid £400 a week to design dresses for the Nico Bridal Company, based in Liverpool, after a heated row. Ms Madine fired the 31-year-old, who she had previously praised with taking her business to 'another level' after six years."

The Mountain View-based tech giant wouldn't detail its plans for the properties. Last year Microsoft opened a 20,000-square-foot space in Playa Vista, a neighborhood near major freeways, several neighborhoods and Los Angeles International Airport. Facebook has operations nearby, as do other major media companies and ad agencies. Three years ago, Google opened a campus in Venice, where it leased 100,000 square feet in three buildings for about 600 employees. One of those buildings is the famous Binoculars Building, a three-story office on Main Street designed by architect Frank Gehry. 'Spruce Goose':The plot is next to a historic hangar where aviator Howard Hughes built his famous 'Spruce Goose' airplane . A Google spokeswoman said the company, which typically likes to expand near its existing properties, will continue to rent the 69,000-square-foot Binoculars Building. Google views the Playa Vista land purchase as a long-term investment and has no particular design in mind for the site, she told the Times. Google also rents a 41,000-square-foot video production facility for subsidiary YouTube in a renovated former Hughes building in Playa Vista. Google already has bought or rented about 6.2 million square feet of space this year in the San Francisco Bay Area, bringing its total there to 15 million square feet, according to real estate brokerage statistics cited by the Times."

         "Maria Ridulph's remain were exhumed Wednesday, 54 years after her death . Investigators hope new tests will bolster their case . The man accused of killing the 7-year-old is being extradited from Seattle .",
         "(CNN) -- Investigators Wednesday exhumed the body of a 7-year-old Illinois girl slain more than five decades ago in hopes that modern science will bolster the case against the man now accused of killing her. The remains of Maria Ridulph, dead since 1957, were exhumed for tests as the 71-year-old suspect in her killing was headed back to Illinois from Seattle, DeKalb County State's Attorney Clay Campbell told reporters. \"Suffice to say science has advanced greatly, thankfully, since that time and we're hoping that advancement in science can assist us in our investigation of this case,\" Campbell said. Ridulph disappeared while playing with a friend near her home in Sycamore, Illinois, about 60 miles west of Chicago. Her body was found five months later and 120 miles away. Jack Daniel McCullough, the man now facing murder charges in her death, was an early suspect in the disappearance but had an alibi: He told police that he was at a military recruiting station in Rockford, Illinois, about 20 miles away, the evening Ridulph was reported missing. McCullough told investigators he had been given a train ticket from Rockford to Chicago by the military, then returned home and went on a date with his girlfriend. But when police interviewed the woman again in 2010 and asked if she had any photos of McCullough, she discovered an unused train ticket from Rockford to Chicago that she said he had given her on the date of the crime. The discovery led to McCullough's arrest in Seattle in early July. Campbell said Wednesday that McCullough was en route to Illinois from Washington state to face murder charges in Ridulph's death. Maria's brother, Charles Ridulph, appeared at a news conference with Campbell and said the family had agreed to the exhumation. \"Although the events were very difficult and very unsettling, we understand the necessity for these things, and we are in complete agreement and thankful for the way this case is being handled,\" he said."

Rumours are circulating that Sony is preparing to launch its next generation games console soon after the Japanese tech giant sent out invitations to an event on 'the future of PlayStation.' Sony would not say whether it was preparing to unveil the successor to the 70million selling PS3 at the February 20 meeting in New York, but the prospect had gamers abuzz on Twitter. 'We will be talking about the PlayStation business,' Sony spokesman Masaki Tsukakoshi said today. Tantalising: A still from the video Sony released to drum up excitement over its PlayStation announcement . Despite that, the scale of the excitement over the meeting was indicated by a Google search for 'Sony Feb 20 PlayStation' which returned more than 7million hits. The last time Sony held a PlayStation event, in January 2011, it presented a protoype of its handheld Vita console. Before that, it convened a gathering in 2005 two months after it first demonstrated the PS3 concept. A meeting in 1999 revealed designs for the PS2. It has been more than six years since Sony launched the PS3 home console, a longer gap than between it and its PS2 predecessor, adding to the anticipation that it will soon disclose its next gaming concept. Current generation: Sony's super-slim . PlayStation 3 has been on the market for more than six years, selling some 70million units, making the . Japanese technology firm long overdue a new flagship product launch . Despite remaining tight-lipped about the specific purpose of the press conference, the company published a teaser video about the meeting on YouTube which has already been viewed more than 400,000 times in less than 24 hours. The video also promoted a Twitter hashtag, #Playstation2013, to which video game fans flocked to share their excitement about the forthcoming event. It was clear that most expected to see the PS4 unveiled. '#playstation2013 I am ready for next gen consoles !!!' wrote Dogukan Celik on the social messaging site. David Brammell Jr tweeted: 'I may not be ready for a new console yet. I might be getting one sooner that I think. Mystery Sony conference in Feb. #playstation2013 #PS4.' Such a console would follow Nintendo's Wii U, which launched last autumn, and precede Microsoft's next Xbox game console, which will likely be unveiled in June at the E3 video game conference in Los Angeles. The PlayStation Vita: The portable console, successor to the PSP, was unveiled the last time Sony held a PlayStation event, in January 2011 . Since Sony's last home console launch, the games market has been transformed by the boom in smartphones and tablet computers that have wooed players with free or cheap games. Sony and its video game rivals Nintendo and Microsoft now have to contend with competition from powerful hand-held devices made by Apple, Samsung and a string of others. Analysts expect that tablets and other mobile devices will match the power and graphics of today's games consoles within a few years. Many are already able to run the kinds of 3D games that were once the exclusive preserve of those dedicated machines and high-spec gaming PCs. Struggling under competitive pressure, Nintendo on Wednesday cut its sales target for the Wii U, successor to its 100million-selling Wii, to 4million machines by the end of March from its launch in November. That compared with an earlier forecast for 5.5million."

Ms Fluke was due to testify at a . hearing on Capitol Hill last month about Barack Obama's mandate that . health insurers provide contraception. The Senate yesterday defeated a GOP effort to roll back President Barack Obama's policy on contraception insurance coverage. It was the first vote on an issue that has raised controversy on religious and women's rights. The close 51-48 vote killed an amendment to allow employers and insurers to opt out of portions of the President's health care law they found morally objectionable. But committee chairman Darrell Issa of . California said she could not testify at the hearing as it was focused . on threats to religious freedom. Ms Fluke later put her testimony on . YouTube and spoke about a friend who had to take birth control to treat a . disorder that caused ovarian cysts. The friend subsequently lost her . ovary. She also spoke of classmates who can’t afford contraception, . which was what really riled Mr Limbaugh. Ms Fluke claimed a female student spends $3,000 on protected sex during a three-year course at university, reported ABC News. ‘Three thousand dollars for birth . control in three years? That’s $1,000 a year of sex - and, she wants us . to pay for it,’ Mr Limbaugh said. Spokesman: Ms Fluke was due to testify at a hearing on Capitol Hill last month about Barack Obama's mandate that health insurers provide contraception - but she wasn't allowed to do so .

'She's having so much sex she can't . afford her own birth control pills and she agrees that Obama should . provide them, or the Pope.’ Should U.S. university students' health insurance cover birth control costs? Female rights activists were left . seething and two Democrats walked out of the Capitol Hill hearing last . month after it was led by an all-male panel. Ms Fluke did eventually speak about . birth control at a Democratic hearing led by House Minority Leader Nancy . Pelosi last week, reported ABC News. She is a third-year law student at Georgetown and ex-president of the Students for Reproductive Justice group at the university. Mr Limbaugh also hit out at NASCAR driver Danica Patrick this week on Monday for backing contraceptive insurance coverage.

A mother has shed more than half her body weight for the festive season after being disgusted by a photo taken at a Christmas party last year. Carol Bryant, 42, from Brighton, was 'horrified' by her 21 stone frame when she saw a photo of herself socialising with a friend. The full-time mother vowed to shed the weight in time for the following festive season - and this year she will be rewarded for her efforts as she can host her own Christmas party as a svelte size 12.

Slim: Carol has now dropped from 21 stone to 9 stone 10lbs and a trim size 12 after going on an extreme diet . She said: 'I was mortified when the photo went up on Facebook. l didn't even recognise myself at first, I looked like a Christmas pudding.' Determined to change her ways, in January 2013 she decided to try a meal replacement programme which limits your daily calorie intake to just 500 calories each day. 'I knew I had to do something about my weight,' she explained. Ian Marber, nutritionist says: 'The diets are monitored and so are considered safe for that reason. 'But very low calorie diets are not to be undertaken in the long term without supervision and also, importantly, clearance from your GP. 'It's what you eat after the diet has finished that's vital and I recommend seeing a nutrition professional afterwards to learn how to eat, not how to diet.' 'I was absolutely massive and I was terrified I would have a heart attack. 'Not to mention how awful I looked in photographs next to my slim friends.

And I feel incredible.' Devastated by seeing herself in the photos Carol vowed to boycott Christmas parties until she lost the weight . Unsurprisingly, Carol's 5000 calorie-a-day diet saw her weight balloon from 15 stone and a size 16, to a massive 21 stone and a size 28 . 'No role model': Carol quit her job working in an office to become a full-time mother to Lois, now six, pictured, but found herself spending a lot of time on the sofa . Carol had always struggled with her weight. When she was in her teens she was a size 16, then in 2007 after having her daughter Lois, now six, she piled on more pounds. This year she will be rewarded for her efforts and hosting her own Christmas party as a svelte size 12 . She quit her job working in an office to become a full-time mother, but would spend her days sat on the sofa gorging on greasy take-aways, fatty chocolates and salty crisps. Unsurprisingly, her 5000 calorie-a-day diet saw her weight balloon from 15 stone and a size 16, to a massive 21 stone and a size 28. Carol says: 'It was disgusting how large I got, and I was no role model for my little girl. I was constantly hungry and would shovel platefuls of food down my throat without even thinking. It was an addiction.' But within the first two weeks of her diet, Carol had lost an incredible 24Ibs. 'The weight was just falling off of me,' she said. 'It was an amazing feeling and it spurned me on to lose more weight.' Carol also began walking every day so she now she weighs in at just 9st 10Ibs, dress size 12.

         "\"Sapeurs\" are a Congolese sub-culture of dapper dressers . Despite usually working menial jobs, they wear expensive European labels . Daniele Tamagni snapped Sapeurs for his book \"Gentlemen of Bacongo\"",
         "Sporting only the most stylish designer labels, wearing only meticulously matched colors, the Congo's dandies are the very embodiment of sartorial elegance. Known as \"Sapeurs,\" these dapper dressers are a Congolese subculture devoted to the cult of style. In Brazzaville and Kinshasa -- the capitals of neighboring Republic of the Congo and the Democratic Republic of the Congo -- they stand out among the widespread poverty, strutting the streets like walking works of art. \"It's the fetishization of fashion -- they are the worshippers of fashion, it's their god, it's powerful,\" says Didier Gondola, author of \"History of the Congo,\" who has extensively researched the Sapeurs. But for the Sapeurs -- who are almost always men -- it's not about what's in vogue, it's about style. The labels they covet most are those that evoke classic elegance. Suits by Yves Saint Laurent, Jean Paul Gaultier and Armani are all in demand, as are Japanese labels Kenzo and Yamamoto, says Gondola. When it comes to shoes, exclusive French label Weston and British label Church's reign supreme. And imitations will not be tolerated. \"You can lose your reputation if you are wearing imitation,\" says Gondola. \"That's something blasphemous.\" See also: Desert festival: Oasis for sounds of the Sahara . But these labels don't come cheap. Gondola, who was born in the Congo and teaches history at Indiana University in the United States, explains that Sapeurs aren't rich; they typically work menial jobs, and have been known to resort to shoplifting to feed their addiction to apparel. In Brazzaville, it's common for Sapeurs to rent or borrow clothes from fellow fops or requisition them from friends visiting from Europe. As the Congolese Diaspora has spread, so have the Sapeurs. They can now be found in European capitals including London, Brussels and Paris. Dixy Ndalla, 30, was born and raised in Brazzaville, but has lived in London since the age of 17. He's infatuated with the classic cuts worn by the British aristocracy and can spend £1,000 a month on new shirts and jackets. \"I am very passionate about clothing, I'm passionate about colors and suits,\" he says. \"In the winter it's anything to do with tweeds, in the summertime a nice blazer, a beautiful pair of jeans, a beautiful shirt. \"I especially love Hackett, one of the top designers in the UK ... Hackett suits start from around £600 and a bespoke made-to-measure will go out from £1,000 and upward.\" Ndalla travels back to Brazzaville in the summer and takes pride in showing off his very British attire. \"In the summer holidays, everyone goes to show their outfits,\" he says. \"They all meet in one street or bars and they all show their colors or the label of their suits ... it's up to people to judge and appreciate who's dressed well.\" Once dressed in their finery, Brazzaville's Sapeurs will often head to \"Le Main Bleu,\" a favorite bar, where they have informal contests. Each tries to out Sap each other with their combination of style, comportment and designer labels -- known as \"griffes.\" But Ndalla doesn't consider himself a Sapeur, because he doesn't dress up to compete with others. For him, it's simply about taking pride in what you wear. \"People from Congo love to dress up -- it's something that's in my blood,\" he says. Although every Sapeur has their own unique style, certain looks are especially popular. Pastel-colored three-piece suits are a staple of the Sapeurs' fastidiously assembled ensembles. They are finished off with a tie, cravat or bow tie -- and the obligatory pocket square protruding from their immaculately tailored jackets. Cigars and pipes -- lit or unlit -- are de rigueur. Italian photographer Daniele Tamagni stumbled across the Sapeurs when he travelled to Brazzaville in 2007. The next year he returned to photograph them, collecting his images in the book \"Gentlemen of Bacongo.\" He says individuals often belong to sub groups within the Sapeur culture, such as the Piccadilly group, who dress in Scottish kilts. \"One member has a sister in Scotland who brings him kilts,\" he explains. \"They use and they adapt to their taste and individuality. They are masters of style, they create their own style.\" See also: Congo's erupting volcano boosts tourism . Some disapprove of the Sapeurs spending what little money they have on the frivolities of fashion. But Gondola argues that being a Sapeur isn't just about vanity -- it's a political statement. In the 1970s \"authenticity\" was part of the state ideology in the DRC -- a policy that prohibited the wearing of Western suits. The Sapeurs rebelled by wearing aggressively non-conformist clothes, including leather suits, says Gondola. To this day Kinshasa's Sapeurs dress less conservatively than their suit-sporting Brazzaville brethren. \"The Sapeur is also about masculinity, politics, changing the stereotypes about how people view Africa,\" says Gondola. \"It's about a lot of things, about beating the West at its own game, which is fashion: 'You colonized us but we dress better than you.'\" Gondola says the history of the Sapeurs can be traced back to the 19th century, when the Republic of the Congo was a French colony. Some colonial masters would pay their servants in used clothes, and those servants would make a show of wearing their masters' clothes on Sundays. He adds that the phenomenon grew in the 1920s and 30s among Congolese nationals living in Paris -- in particular Sap pioneer and anti-colonial activist André Matswa. But it really took off after independence in 1960, when ordinary Congolese people would travel to Paris and return home wearing the latest fashions. In the 1970s, popular musician Papa Wemba, from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (formerly Zaire), began promoting the idea of the Sapeur, forming the \"Société des Ambianceurs et Persons Élégants,\" or SAPE, of which many modern-day Sapeurs claim membership. So what is the enduring appeal of the Sapeur? \"It's politics, spiritual, aesthetic, social -- so many things,\" says Gondola. \"It's a whole science -- they are artists.\""

         "In 2009, nine men in a Bolivian Mennonite community were jailed for raping at least 100 women and girls . The gang used a powerful sedative adapted from a tranquilizer to drug households before carrying out the attacks at Manitoba Colony . Women were not initially believed despite waking to blood-soaked sheets . Despite the convictions, it has emerged attacks in the colony have continued .",
         "By . Becky Evans . PUBLISHED: . 10:22 EST, 6 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 11:56 EST, 6 August 2013 . The spate of terrifying night-time rapes in an isolated, orthodox Christian community went on for four years and yet the victims could barely remember the ordeal and many believed they had dreamed it. It was not until 2009 that nine men were eventually convicted of the rape of more than 100 women and girls in their own homes in the Mennonite Manitoba Colony in Bolivia. But despite the convictions, it has emerged that the sexual attacks in the closed community are continuing. More than 100 women and girls were raped in the Mennonite Manitoba Colony in Bolivia but despite the convictions four years ago residents have admitted that the sexual assaults have continued (file picture) An investigation has uncovered that once more women and youngsters in the Old Colony, where motorised vehicles and electricity are banned, are suffering sexual assaults they can barely remember. Vice.com has found that many families believe the assaults are continuing despite the men, aged 19 to 43, being jailed. But members of the closed community told Vice . that without cameras or streetlights - both forbidden in the community - or a police force, they have no way to stop or catch the rapists. They say they will have to wait until someone is caught in the act and in the meantime increase security at their homes. One husband, whose wife was raped in the first spate of attacks, told Vice.com: 'It's definitely not as frequent.  are being much more careful than before, but it still goes on.' From 2005 to 2009, women complained that they regularly woke up to intense pain and semen and blood on their sheets but their claims were not initially investigated and they were not believed. Some even reported waking up to find rope tied to their wrists or ankles or dirty fingerprints on their bodies but the victims could not remember the previous night. Many women had hazy memories or images of at least one man on top of them but they were not able to resist. Residents say they have heard repeated rumours that the night-time rapes have continued but because the closed community does not have a police force the alleged crimes are unlikely to be investigated (file picture) The Manitoba Colony in eastern Bolivia is home to about 3,000 people . The eventual trial found that the attackers used a powerful sedative to drug whole families before carrying out the rapes. Many . women were attacked as they lay next to their husbands, who were also . knocked unconscious by the narcotic. A girl of just three was among the victims and a woman of 60 years old. A pregnant woman gave birth at just six and a half months after being raped while unconscious. Young girls were taken to hospital the next morning suffering from terrible pain and bleeding. The gang of men, who had led some women to believe they were repeatedly attacked by demons, were eventually caught and jailed in 2009. Two of the men were found trying to break into a house and their story unraveled. Each of the nine-strong gang were jailed for 25 years and a vet who supplied the anaesthetic - made from a cow tranquilizer - was sentenced to 12 years. The colony - about 94 miles from Santa Cruz and home to about 3,000 ultraconservative Mennonites - has been deeply scarred by the scandal. Sara Guenter told Vice that she tried to stay awake and asked a trusted worker to guard the house but the attacks continued when no one was watching her home. She said: 'It happened so many times, I lost count.' Some residents initially believed the rape claims were concocted to hide affairs while others believed it was down to 'wild female imagination.' Electricity is banned in the Old . Colonies and the community lives off the land. Men and women's roles are . strictly segregated with men working as farmers and given extra education whereas . women only are responsible for cleaning and cooking. The community has no police force so no one investigated the claims until two men were finally caught trying to break into a neighbour's house. Before that there had been no investigation and the authorities were accused of turning a blind eye to the situation. Abraham Walls Enns, Manitoba Colony's civic leader told Vice: 'That's all behind us now. We'd rather forget than have it be at the forefront of our minds. 'We only knew that something strange was happening in the night. 'But we didn't know who was doing it, so how could we stop it?' Offers of help from outside of the colony, including from more liberal Mennonite communities in Canada and elsewhere, were rejected. Orders for psychological help for victims has also never materialised. Old Colony Mennonites do not use motorised vehicles or electricity . Mennonites are Christians that can be traced from Protestant groups on Europe. They follow the teachings of 16th Century priest Menno Simons, who gave the group his name. There are about 1.7million Mennonites in 82 countries, with prominent communities in Canada, the U.S., Ethiopia, India, and parts of south and central America including Bolivia, Mexico and Paraguay. Almost 400,000 Mennonites live in the U.S. with more than 220,000 living in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The vast majority of Bolivia's Mennonite population are ultraconservative. Over the centuries, members have been severely persecuted and partially due to their pacifism Mennonites fled to other lands where they were tolerated. In the Old Colonies, motorised vehicles, electricity, dance and sport are all banned. Old Order Mennonites tend to use horse and buggies for transportation and speak in a German dialect."

         "(CNN) -- Sina Weibo, China's most popular microblogging platform, has introduced a VIP paid membership package in an effort to monetize its vast community of 324 million users who use its services for free. The VIP membership includes fifteen \"special privileges\" under the categories of user personalization, functions, mobile phone, and security. These perks range from using fancier homepage templates, following a higher number of users, and receiving SMS birthday alerts and password reminders. Users can increasingly access these features, as they progress through six different levels of membership based on points awarded for usage. A one-month subscription is priced at 10 RMB (US$ 1.57). Discounts are offered for longer subscriptions of three months to two years. The VIP package has generally been met with muted enthusiasm by industry analysts. The free features of the site are sufficient for users, You Tianyu, an analyst at Beijing-based internet consultancy iResearch, told state newspaper, Global Times. He predicted the premium services would not be significantly profitable and recommended that Sina concentrate on advertising and gaming revenues. This move follows monetization initiatives introduced last year, such as \"Weibi\" virtual currency and \"Weihao\" custom account numbers. Sina Corporation, which also operates the popular Sina web portal, reported a net loss of US$ 13.7 million for the first quarter of 2012, despite a 6% year-on-year increase in net revenue to $106.2 million."

         "Manchester City have ended their interest in signing Barcelona's Samuel Eto'o . The move fell through because Eto'o wanted to be paid a portion of transfer fee . City midfielder Gelson Fernandez and Brazilian striker Jo both leave the club .",
         "(CNN) -- Premier League big-spenders Manchester City will renew their search for a new world-class striker after ending their interest in Barcelona striker Samuel Eto'o. Eto'o will not be playing for Manchester City next season after the English club ended their interest in him. The Cameroon international, who is about to embark on the last year of his contract at the Nou Camp, felt he should receive a significant portion of the £18million ($29m) fee City were willing to pay -- as he would be entitled to leave for nothing next summer. City manager Mark Hughes initially signalled his intention to wait for Eto'o to resolve the wrangle. Yet, as the week has dragged on, the argument has just got more confusing and complicated. Latest transfer rumors and gossip . It was suggested City were ready to offer Eto'o a deadline of this weekend to determine his future. However, in the end, City chairman Khaldoon al-Mubarak did not even give the 28-year-old that long, with Barcelona officially contacted on Friday with confirmation the deal was off. \"Samuel Eto'o is undoubtedly a fine footballer but the circumstances surrounding him were such that the deal could not be completed,\" City chief executive Garry Cook told the club's official Web site. \"We now feel the time is right to pursue other avenues. We have a clear strategic transfer plan, which we continue to follow.\" England midfielder Gareth Barry and Paraguayan striker Roque Santa Cruz have already joined the club this summer and Argentine forward Carlos Tevez is expected to complete his move from rivals Manchester United in the near future. Chelsea and England captain John Terry and Everton defender Joleon Lescott also remain high on the club's wish-list. Meanwhile, two players leaving the club are midfielder Gelson Fernandes and Brazilian striker Jo. Swiss international Fernandes has completed his move to French side St Etienne, while Jo has returned to Everton on loan for the season. In other transfer news, Sunderland have swooped to sign Manchester United's reserve team striker Fraizer Campbell for £3.5m ($5.67m) on a four-year contract."

         "NEW: \"Hell awaits your arrival,\" the daughter of one victim tells Anthony Sowell . Sowell was convicted of 11 counts of aggravated murder and 70 other charges . The jury earlier this week recommended he be put to death . Defendant apologized during sentencing phase .",
         "(CNN) -- A judge Friday upheld a Cleveland, Ohio, jury's recommendation that convicted serial killer Anthony Sowell be sentenced to death. Jurors convicted Sowell of 11 counts of aggravated murder and more than 70 other charges, including abusing corpses and kidnapping. Wednesday, they recommended the death penalty. The convictions ended a saga that began in October 2009 with the discovery of the first two victims' remains inside Sowell's home in Cleveland. He eventually was accused of killing at least 11 women ranging in age from 25 to 52. Cuyahoga County Judge Dick Ambrose imposed the sentence Friday morning. He could have overruled jurors and imposed a life sentence. Sowell, who pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity, had his eyes closed during almost all of Friday's hearing, CNN affiliates reported. He made no comment. Family members of the victims were allowed to make statements. \"Anthony, you will deal with a much higher power for the pain you have caused,\" said Donnita Carmichael, daughter of victim Tonia Carmichael. \"You are an animal and hell awaits your arrival.\" Sowell's lawyers had asked for life in prison. Parole would not have been an option because Sowell, 51, is classified as a \"sexually violent predator.\" During the penalty phase of his trial, Sowell said he was \"sorry.\" \"I know that may not sound like much. But I truly am sorry from the bottom of my heart,\" he said. During his trial, Sowell maintained a candid banter with members of his defense team as he recounted claims of childhood abuse -- both physical and sexual. He grew up in East Cleveland, joined the Marines at age 18 and traveled to California, North Carolina and Japan, authorities said. Sowell served 15 years in prison for attempted rape before being released in 2005. People who met him after his release described him as \"a normal guy.\" He was known locally for selling scrap metal. Sowell's inconspicuous two-story home sat in a dilapidated neighborhood known as Mount Pleasant. A stench hovered around the area, but no one realized it was the scent of decaying human flesh, instead assuming it was a byproduct of a nearby sausage factory. Many of Sowell's victims struggled with drug addiction at some point, and court records showed many resorted to stealing and prostitution to support their habits. The disappearances of the women -- many of whom lived near him -- went largely unnoticed for two years, with only four women being reported missing."

         "By . Sara Nathan . They have made no secret of their growing love after spending the past few months jet setting around the world together. And one of Michelle Rodriguez's closest confidants has revealed she is so in love with British supermodel Cara Delevingne that she believes she is 'the one' - and wants to start a family with her. In an exclusive interview with MailOnline, the friend of the Fast and Furious . star - who has asked to remain unnamed - reveals how Michelle, 35, is so besotted by Cara, 21, that she . has already told pals she would love a baby with her. But while the actress is planning her future with Cara - who is 14 years younger than her - we can reveal the Mulberry model’s family is terrified of the influence the wayward star is having on the top model who has become the toast of the fashion industry. Scroll down for videos . Inseparable: Before jetting to Italy Cara, 21, and 35-year-old Michelle were seen out on the town in London . The start of something: Model Cara Delevingne shared a kiss . with openly bisexual actress Michelle Rodriguez as they sat courtside at the . New York Knicks game at Madison Square Garden in January. Baring all: Michelle Rodriguez shared a photo on Instagram on Tuesday which showed her stark naked while meditating . The . source, who Michelle regularly confides in, said: 'Michelle comes from . a broken home and it has a lot to do with why she has found herself in . trouble again and again throughout her life. 'Constantly, . she pushes boundaries and has been in trouble with the law, but really . all of it is because she is desperate to be loved. 'Her mom and dad separated when she was a child and ever since Michelle has been yearning for some stability in her life. 'Sadly after years of dating older women and men like Olivier Martinez, nothing seemed to work out for her. 'But now Cara has come along, who is so much younger than the women she normally dates, but suddenly Michelle is happy again.' In . recent years, former Lost star Michelle, who openly admits she is bisexual, has endured a string of broken relationships after dating French heartthrob and S.W.A.T co-star Olivier Martinez, Fast and Furious co-star Vin Diesel as well as model Claudette Lali, director Francesca De Sola and . model Aleksandra Rastovic. The source claims Michelle had a 'great thing' going with Terminator 3 actress Kristanna Loken - who strongly hinted to Advocate magazine that she was in a relationship with her in 2006, yet Michelle has never confirmed their relationship. 'Kristanna wanted to come out as a couple. She's proud to be bisexual, but Michelle wasn't ready to go public,' said the friend: 'So instead of working it out, Michelle ended it. Smitten: Michelle was linked with Terminator 3 actress Kristanna Loken, who hinted the couple were in a relationship in 2006 . Ex-lovers: Michelle Rodriguez iis said to have dated flimmaker Francesca de Sola. The pair are pictured at the screening of Francesca's film 1%ers in New York in April 2013 . 'Then she was left heartbroken a year later when she fell for another model/actress only to find out she had slept with someone else while she was away filming the movie Avatar.' The actress has also found herself behind bars after being in trouble repeatedly with the . law. In March 2002, she was . charged with assault and harassment when her girlfriend, Louise Ward, . claimed the tough girl had attacked her in their New Jersey apartment. Ward was left battered and bruised, but later dropped all charges against Michelle. The friend said: 'Michelle can be intense and dive head first into . romances. This can land her in hot water as she found out with Louise. 'Over the last 15-years there have been countless other examples of her disastrous love life.' Just one year later Michelle found herself in trouble again when she . appeared in court to face eight misdemeanor charges relating to two . driving incidents, including a DUI and a hit and run. In . 2004, she pleaded no contest to three of the charges, hit and run, . drunken driving and driving with a suspended license and went to jail . for 48 hours and was placed on probation for three years. And in 2005, while filming ABC hit Lost in Hawaii, the stunning brunette was fined multiple times for speeding. Later . that year on December 1st she was arrested for drunk driving, to which . she pleaded guilty and paid a $500 fine and spent five days in jail. Due . to this being a clear violation of her earlier drunk driving crimes, . she was also sentenced to 60 days in jail, but due to overcrowding was . released on the same day she entered. And it's precisely this behavior that has left Cara's family a little fearful. Michelle's close friend admitted: 'She's a very free spirit and before this relationship she has always been terrified of commitment. “And because of her troubled past, many of them have essentially had to be her babysitter or a mother figure to her. 'So now Cara might be younger than her, but she honestly thinks this is 'the one'. Just before she met Cara she was talking about wanting a family within the next couple of years. Lovers? Michelle Rodriguez reportedly dated Vin Diesel, her Fast and Furious co-star. The pair pose at the premiere of Fast and Furious 6 in Seoul, South Korea, in May 2013 .

'She . really wants a baby and wants one soon and now she has found Cara she . thinks this could finally be the time to chase that dream. 'Sadly due to Michelle’s troubled past, Cara’s family are not so sure.They are not 100 per cent pro this relationship and are in some ways willing it to end. 'The 14-year age gap between the girls concerns them as does Michelle's wayward reputation. 'They . know Cara has been swept off her feet by Michelle, who has dropped . everything to be with her young love, but the family fear the . relationship will end in nothing but disaster. 'I highly doubt at 21-years-old Cara is ready to start a family. She is no doubt currently smitten with Michelle, who dropped everything, including her girlfriend and friends, to be with her. 'But . if anyone is going to get their heart broken in this relationship it's . going to be Michelle. She will smother Cara, and wants to be around her . 24 hours a day.' The couple, who apparently met in . January, were also seen attending Prince's secret gig at Ronnie Scott's . club on Monday, February 17, and the Elle Style Awards the following . evening before heading to Milan to . close the autumn/winter fashion season. They then hired a private jet last week to head to Milan Fashion Week, where Cara had a busy schedule. The pair were spotted in coordinating black outfits while carrying bags as they made their way to their airplane - while the Brit beauty's parents were also along for the trip. After landing in Milan, Michelle sat with her love as she sat in hair and makeup backstage at the Fendi autumn/winter 2014 fashion show. They then flew back to London and are now believed to be on vacation. Supportive: The Fast And Furious star hung out with her model squeeze backstage at Milan Fashion Week . Romantic getaway: It seems Michelle's girlfriend Cara Delevingne might be on the Thailand holiday too as that same day she shared a photo of herself wearing scuba diving gear while in a tropical location . Sexy couple: Michelle's post came days after Cara shared this snapshot . Michelle spoke openly about her sexuality in October after years of speculation, telling Entertainment Weekly, 'I've never walked the carpet with anyone, so they wonder: What does she do with her vagina?\" Plus, I play a butchy girl all the time, so they assume I'm a lesbo.' Asked about the assumptions, she admitted: 'Eh, they're not too far off. I've gone both ways. I do as I please. I am too f--king curious to sit here and not try when I can. Men are intriguing. So are chicks.' This week, Michelle posted a picture of herself naked, revealing her bare derriere to the world as she appeared to be meditating. She was seen lapping up the sunshine in Thailand, where she is . currently enjoying a getaway, and the snapshot also showed a stunning . ocean view. And it is likely that the photo was taken by Cara, as that same day the model shared a picture of herself clad . in scuba diving gear in an equally tropical location. Michelle’s snap comes just days after her model squeeze shared her own extremely sexy picture on the social networking site. The source added: 'You can see from the photos of them out together in London that they are clearly having fun. 'They . don't seem to have a care in the world and I know Michelle will pay for . everything, go everywhere with her and has unlimited funds to do as . they please. 'To begin with . this will be nice and she will be flattered. But when she has to go . away to shoot a film, it will end and Michelle does fall hard. 'And maybe it will all be a little too much for someone as young as Cara.' Turning heads: Michelle attended the BAFTAs in London earlier this month in a silk and leather plunging gown . Blossoming relationship: Michelle and Cara debuted their romance last month at a New York Knicks game ."

And they have had an extra use, illuminating the wedding of his wife's cousin on Saturday. Mr Richards vowed he had retired after setting his 2011 record, but regained the taste for Christmas lights. Now he will not rule out defending himself against further challenges. However, he said he will need a generator if he puts up any more lights.

Mr Yates won a Court of Appeal hearing to get 'fair share' of her money . He said: 'She's got everything. I've got nothing. She can afford to go on holiday, I can't'",
         "John Yates, 59, pictured outside court today, met Ukrainian Marina Ivleva, 49, online but their marriage ended acrimoniously . An internet bride who made her fortune in the UK after marrying a British man she met online is now fighting her in the divorce courts for a 'fair share' of her wealth. Ukrainian Marina Ivleva, 49, left Crimea for Leicester in 1999 after meeting John Yates through an international dating site and went on to earn more than he did. She had left for Britain for love and a better financial future because the average annual wage can be as low as £2,000-a-year at home. In her 12-years in the UK she has risen to a senior administrator at De Montfort University and amassed assets and cash. Now her truck-driving husband, who lives in a council house after they split two years ago, is taking her to court because he claims he deserves the 'fair share' of her wealth. Mrs Ivleva is living in their home in Leicester with her grown up son from a previous marriage, Robert, 26. Mr Yates says he is languishing with 'nothing' in council accommodation and insists he is due a 'fair share' of her money. The Court of Appeal heard that Mrs Ivleva told Mr Yates that she had divorced him in Ukraine, and this has sparked a bitter legal battle. She then tried to get her foreign divorce recognised in England in March but High Court judge Mr Justice Peter Jackson refused. He said that Mrs Ivleva had 'trailed her coat' by keeping her husband in the dark about details of the Ukrainian proceedings until it was too late for him to do anything about them. Describing their relationship as a 'limping marriage', he said 'basic fairness' to Mr Yates demanded that he be given the opportunity to divorce his wife in England. In his 'emphatic' ruling, the judge said that, although the divorce had been advertised in a Ukrainian newspaper, Mr Yates spoke very little of his wife's native language. In the latest legal skirmish Mrs Ivleva's son spoke on her behalf as she challenged the judge's decision at the Court of Appeal. Split: The couple, pictured together in 2005, broke up two years ago and Mrs Ivleva has claimed that she already secured a divorce in Ukraine - but the British court won't accept it . She claimed to have suffered discrimination as a foreign wife and that the ruling amounted to an 'attack on the integrity' of the Ukrainian courts. However, sitting judge Lady Justice King sided with Mr Yates and described the judge's refusal to recognise her Ukrainian divorce as 'exemplary' and 'unimpeachable'. The ruling opened the way for Mr Yates to pursue his county court divorce petition and seek financial orders against his wife. He said outside court after the ruling: 'She's got everything. I've got nothing and I'm entitled to a fair share. 'I'm living in council accommodation from day-to-day. She can afford to go on holiday. I can't'. He added that he expected his decree nisi to go through on January 5, finally ending his marriage."

         "Nicolle and both Rosies said 'no way!' to Whoopi's siding with Michigan dad who punished 4-year-old by forcing him to hold shameful sign in public . Day 3 of the revamped look and lineup, with guests Tim McGraw and Neil Patrick Harris, was tamer by far than day 2 . On Tuesday, Nicolle Wallace and Rosie O'Donnell seriously butted heads over Wallace's boss George W.'s response to Hurricane Katrina .",
         "Whoopi Goldberg had her The View co-hosts all rallied against her during a discussion in which she supported a highly controversial discipline technique in the third episode of the revamped series Wednesday. With Nicolle Wallace, Rosie O'Donnell and Rosie Perez all shaking their heads in abject disapproval, Whoopi sided with a Michigan dad who recently forced his 4-year-old son to humiliate himself on a roadside with a sign that read 'I hit little girls.' 'That father took a great step and I'm proud of him,' Whoopi said of the man who could lose custody of his son for the stunt. Scroll down for video... Whose side are you on? Whoopi thinks a Michigan man who punished his 4-year-old by forcing him to hold up a humiliating sign was in the right . Rosie Perez was first to shun what Rob Devine forced his son Tristan to do. 'He's a little kid,' the actress asserted, raising her signature voice for one of the first times since joining the show. 'He's 4-years-old, it's a little bit extreme.' Whoopi wouldn't back down, though, so former George W. Bush aide Nicolle Wallace put in her two-cents. 'I don't think you teach a kid a lesson by shaming,' said the communications maven. Then, as if to make amends for the rift that emerged between them on Tuesday, a miracle happened: resident fiery liberal Rosie O'Donnell agree with Wallace. 'Shame is never a way to teach a child anything' said O'Donnell, whose own special-needs son once grappled with a hitting problem before the family sought therapy. 'They're not emotionally ready to understand.' But even in an episode where the panel touched on the Adrian Peterson child abuse issue and selfies in the gynecologist's office, day three was a departure from day two when Wallace and O'Donnell shared some seriously tens . Disagreement: It was Whoopi's turn to anger the group on Wednesday as she sided with a father with some controversial thoughts on displinine . Whoopi agreed: The creative punishment used by Rob Devine (right) when he discovered his son Tristan had been harassing female classmates became a source of a classic The View clash. Nicolle and both Rosies said 4-year-old is too young to humiliate a child . The once-booted co-host compared a characterization Wallace made of Obama's lack of warmth with the 'international incident' that came when rapper Kanye West publicly declared that Bush's response (or lack thereof) to the Katrina disaster meant he hated black people. 'He revealed was how personally wounded he was by that statement,' Wallace said of her then boss, who wrote of his dismay over West's assertion in his 2010 memoir Decision Points. She then called O'Donnell's words 'an attack.' O'Donnell snatched the opportunity to turn Wallace's words against her. 'He was very upset in the plane as he flew over Katrina,' quipped the comedienne. 'It was a very long time before he showed up. That is a fact, not an attack.' Wallace, who just the day before admitted on the show that she had nothing to do with Bush's decision not to visit Katrina--but simply fly over it--was forced to agree. Ironically, on the season's same inaugural episode, O'Donnell made sure to say of Wallace: 'I like her, I swear!' Whether that's true or not, the hot and cold chemistry appears to have worked, at least for the time being. The season 15 premier on Monday won the show its highest ratings in eight years. According to The Wrap, it's the second most watched premier ever for the daytime series. More to come? Republican Nicolle Wallace and liberal Rosie O'Donnell traded some harsh words during a very tense moment on just the second episode of The View's new lineup ."

         "Kevin Pietersen’s autobiography has lifted the lid of all the frailties and insecurities professional sportsmen feel in the dressing room . International cricketers are away from home for months on end and see more of their team-mates than their families . There have always been cliques in the England dressing room and always will be .",
         "One of the most fascinating aspects of Kevin Pietersen’s autobiography for the public must be the revealing of all the frailties and insecurities professional sportsmen feel in the dressing room. It’s certainly not as harmonious or lovey-dovey as people might presume. Players are always getting on each other’s nerves or having issues to resolve. You hear professional footballers whingeing if they are away for longer than a couple of weeks at a World Cup but international cricketers are away from home for months on end and see more of their team-mates than their families. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Pietersen say a good coach would have managed the situation . Kevin Pietersen has lifted the lid on all the frailties and insecurities in the dressing room . There will always be tensions, particularly when you consider the highly-pressurised environment they work in and that every move they make is scrutinised and analysed. The Manchester United footballers Teddy Sheringham and Andy Cole famously didn’t get on and in my England team Darren Gough and Andy Caddick had their moments, but that doesn’t really matter. As I said in these pages the other day, Michael Holding will tell you that some members of the great West Indies side didn’t get on. Shane Warne will say the same about his Australian team. But once they stepped on that field they respected each other and did everything in their power to win the game for their team. I liken it to sitting an examination every day of the week, and we all know how nervous and tetchy our kids can be the day before an exam. It is why there will always be niggles between team-mates and why they won’t always get on. Team-mates Teddy Sheringham and Andy Cole famously didn't get on at Manchester United . I’ve heard about the accusation of cliques in the England dressing room but that has always been the case and always will be. There will always be groups of three or four players who prefer to spend time with each other. When you are away for three months, you can’t expect everyone to go out together every night. You have to treat players like adults and in return they must have respect for one another even if they are not mates. There was plenty of banter and mickey-taking in the England dressing room when I played but someone like Marcus Trescothick, perhaps because he was teased about his weight when he was young, was always good at reminding anyone to be careful about not crossing the line. Rarely would we have a go at each other about cricketing mistakes because it was all so important but Mike Atherton, for one, would always remind me if I got out to a bad shot. It was just that he would wait a few days before doing so. Darren Gough (left) and Andy Caddick had their moments when Nasser Hussain was England captain . That is not bullying to me and I can honestly say I have never considered any cross words or mickey-taking in any England team I have played in — or watched — to be bullying. Yes, the England team is a tough school but if you can’t cope with a few tough words from your team-mates how are you going to cope with Mitchell Johnson and Brad Haddin? But I do agree with some of what Pietersen has said. I have long disagreed with how often the England bowlers would have a go at anyone who misfielded or dropped a catch and I was amazed at how long that was allowed to continue. Apart from anything else it plays into the hands of the opposition. They will look at that and say: ‘We’ve got this lot on the run. They are at each other.’ It just wasn’t a good look and I’m glad that there seems less of that sort of thing now. Nasser Hussain tried to embrace ‘difficult characters' like Phil Tufnell when he was England captain . And if it is true that people had to stand up in front of the group and apologise when they made a mistake then England should be careful. That really is school yard stuff. The flip side is that you want your team to be challenged and pushed to make sure they perform to the best of their ability, and it is not always the captain or the coach who does the challenging. For me, it would hit a lot harder if one of my team-mates, rather than the coach or captain, had a word with me after something and said: ‘Come on Nas, you can do better than that.’ Clearly, this England team pushed each other hard and it seems Pietersen didn’t like to be treated in that way. It does seem that England may have had a tendency to overdo the methods that took them to three Ashes triumphs and No 1 in the world Test rankings. The admonishing of players in the field is one example. Another is their reliance on statistics when, at times, they should have trusted their cricketing instinct more. When I was captain I would try to embrace the so-called ‘difficult characters’ and do everything to concentrate on what they could do rather than what they couldn’t. If people like Phil Tufnell, Caddick and Graham Thorpe could take wickets and score runs for us then they were fine by me. Andy Flower (right) tried to keep KP onside so England would benefit from his considerable talent . You have to treat everyone differently. Pietersen and Alastair Cook have almost identical career records and are two of the best batsmen England have ever had, but as human beings they could not be more different and have to be treated as such. The key with KP, clearly, was trying to keep him happy and make him feel loved. But coach Andy Flower will tell you he did that for five years, he treated Pietersen differently and did everything to manage him and get him onside so England would benefit from the match-winning innings of which he was capable. It’s all very well people saying Kevin was easy to manage when he first came into the side but he would have been wouldn’t he? He was a young player finding his way and there’s no way he would have challenged anyone senior. Pietersen's lucrative contract with Indian Premier League had repercussions for England team . Where everything clearly changed is with the advent of the Indian Premier League. It seemed to make Pietersen believe he was bigger than the team, and perhaps other players became jealous of the money he was making. The dynamic of one of the most successful of all England teams clearly changed. Flower had tired of repeatedly trying to manage Pietersen. When results started going against England and their star batsman was not quite looking like the player he once was, England decided enough was enough. As I have said, there are some valid points here but nearly everyone who has tried to manage him has found him incredibly hard work. Everybody can’t be wrong. So maybe one day Kevin Pietersen might take a look at himself rather than blaming everyone else for the way he has been treated by England. He might have to look back and say: ‘Was it me?’"

         "By . Daily Mail Reporter . Soviet spies have admitted using bugging devices on the Royal Family and former British Prime Minister Harold Wilson. Secret agents from the KGB targeted Princess Margaret in the 1960s, attaching listening aids to her lighter, cigarette case, ashtrays and telephones. According to the Sunday Express, they homed in on the Princess during a trip to Copenhagen, Denmark in 1964. Lord Snowdon And Princess Margaret get ready to board a plane in September 1964 ahead of their visit to Copenhagen. Russian spies have admitted bugging the Princess on the trip . Until now, Russia has always denied the covert operation, which took place in a hotel, but has now admitted compiling a dossier on the Princess's love affair with Robin Douglas-Home and further relationships with Roddy Llewellyn, Colin Tennant and Dominic Ewes, a painter who later committed suicide. Spies passed photos, tape recordings and 'most interesting, even scandalous' gossip involving senior royal figures. It is also said agents tried to get information from Margaret's therapist, Kay Kiernan, who also treated the Queen. Intelligence on Prince Phillip was gathered via society osteopath and artist Stephen Ward, who later killed himself at the height of the Profumo affair. But spies failed in a sting operation on then future leader Harold Wilson, setting up a 'honey trap' for him in a Moscow hotel. Princess Margaret (second from right and then left) was targeted by KGB spies on her visit to Copenhagen in 1964. Bugging devices were planted in her lighter, cigarette case, ashtrays and telephones . A new book will detail the KGB spies' attempts at bugging the Royal Family. Pictured, the Kremlin, in Moscow . Female agents posing as prostitutes patrolled the hotel overlooking the Kremlin, with a camera planted in a chandelier in his bedroom. But when the film was developed, Wilson's face was disguised. Colonel Vadim Goncharov, who has since died, was the KGB chief in charge of the snooping operations, and he was ordered by bosses to go on television to deny the claims, fearing they would cast a shadow over the Queen's first and only visit to Russia in 1994. But last week Russia newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda boasted that among Goncharov's successes was 'the bugging of drunken parties of the British Princess Margaret'. A book published next year, Entitled The Kremlin v The Windsors, by the paper's intelligence analyst Gennady Sokolov will provide further details of the operation, according to the paper. Master spy Goncharov, who staged stings in more than 100 countries and survived assassination attempts, said of the Princess Margaret operation: 'As I recall there were no lovers, though there was a visitor. 'On this occasion our interest was in getting confidential information which would open certain doors for us in Britain.' On the failed attempt at trapping Wilson, he said: 'It was if he was playing games with us.'"

         "Irish Mayor Darren Scully resigns after saying he would no longer represent people of black African origin . He said the black Africans were aggressive towards him and accused him of not standing up for them . As a result, he said on radio, he had decided to actually stop representing them . Opposition parties demanded he step down as mayor of Naas .",
         "County Kildare, Ireland (CNN) -- The mayor of a town in Ireland has resigned and faces a possible police investigation after saying he would no longer represent people of black African origin. Councillor Darren Scully was Mayor of Naas in County Kildare, near the Irish capital, Dublin. Interviewed on local radio Tuesday morning, Scully said he had decided not to represent black Africans because of their \"aggressive\" attitude to him. \"I have been met with aggressiveness, I have been met with bad manners,\" he claimed. \"I have also been played the race card - it's been said 'Oh yeah, you will help white people, but you don't help black people'.\" The then mayor continued: \"After a while I made a decision that I was just not going to take on representations from black Africans, that I would be very courteous to them and I would pass on their query to other public representatives who would take their concerns.\" Members of other political parties called for Scully to resign and Tuesday evening he did just that. He issued the following statement: \"I wish to apologise unreservedly for my remarks on 4FM and KFM. I realise they have caused deep hurt and offence in all communities and in all sectors of society. \"I have been proud to be Mayor of Naas and to represent all the people of the town. However, as a result of the upset that I have caused, I feel it is appropriate that I step down from this position.\" Earlier, political rivals Sinn Fein had accused him of being racist, but in his statement Scully denied the claim. He said: \"I realise now that my remarks were open to an interpretation that I did not intend. I abhor racism in all its forms.\" Naas Town Council had called a special meeting for Tuesday evening to discuss the controversy, but Scully resigned just ahead of it. The now ex-mayor is a member of the main party in the Irish coalition government - Fine Gael - but said he was expressing personal views. The party agreed - Fine Gael issued this statement: \"The views expressed by Cllr Scully do not reflect the views of Fine Gael and they are not party policy. \"Fine Gael is an inclusive party and we are trying to build a country that caters for all.\" A lawmaker with the junior partners in the coalition government, Aodhan O Riordain of the Labour Party, said he had reported the matter to Irish police with a view to prosecution. O Riordain branded Scully's comments \"outrageous\" and said they could be considered as incitement to hatred. The Irish census of 2006 showed there were 1,862 people of African origin living in Kildare out of a population in the county of 186,335, according to the Central Statistics Office in Dublin. Naas has a total population of just over 20,000. Local people told CNN Tuesday that race relations in the town are good and they were \"really surprised\" a local representative would make such comments."

         "By . Suzannah Hills . Cuba's reclusive former President Fidel Castro has been photographed in public for the first time in almost a year. The revolutionary leader attended the inauguration of an art gallery in Havana run by Cuban artist Alexis Leyva, aka Kcho, yesterday. It is the first time Castro has been seen in public since attending a National Assembly meeting in February 2013. Public appearance: Fidel Castro, Cuba's former President and revolutionary leader, looks at the camera during a rare public appearance to attend the inauguration of an art gallery in Havana, Cuba . Support: Castro is helped into the gallery by an aide and a metal walking stick . Castro, who ceded power to his brother Raul Castro in 2008 after falling ill in 2006, has kept a low profile in recent years. But his silence in the wake of Nelson Mandela's death prompted widespread speculation that his health is ailing. The former South African president was a close ally, thanks to Cuba's backing of Angolan fighters who battled forces supported by the previous pro-apartheid South African government of the 1980s. This prompted the release of pictures in December of Castro meeting with a Spanish reporter about current events for more than two hours earlier that month. Recluse: The appearance is the first time Castro has been seen in public since attending a National Assembly meeting in February 2013 . Speculation: Castro's low profile prompted fears about the state of his health . The photo shows Castro, 87, seated and wearing a blue sweatsuit, looking intensely at writer Ignacio Ramonet and gesturing with his left hand. Mr Ramonet and the website Cubadebate say the photo was taken early December. The reporter told the AP that he and Castro discussed a wide range of topics including Mandela, Venezuelan politics and climate change. 'I found him to be in excellent health and in a good mood, physically, mentally and psychologically,' Mr Ramonet said. Castro left power after 47 years after suffering serious intestinal bleeding in 2006, handing his duties to his brother Raul. Castro looks closely at an art piece during a rare public appearance to attend the inauguration of an art gallery run by Cuban artist Alexis Leyva, aka Kcho . Poor health: Castro left power after 47 years after suffering serious intestinal bleeding in 2006 . While Fidel Castro has been out of the spotlight due to his health, his brother Raul has been making enough headlines for them both as he caused a stir after shaking President Obama's hand during the public memorial ceremony for Mandela in South Africa. It then emerged that representatives from the two historically antagonistic nations had already been in talks for six months. During the president's trip back from South Africa, Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes told reporters on Air Force One that 'it's been quite some time since the Presidents of the United States and Cuba were even in the same place.' But he acknowledged that 'we’re in talks on issues associated with migration that, again, I think allow for there to be greater connectivity particularly among Cuban Americans and Cuba.' Castro ceded power to his brother Raul Castro in 2008 and has kept a low profile ever since . Official pictures have been released of Castro in recent months to quell the mounting speculation over his health ."

How intelligent! So much generosity has failed to let him understand that after 50 years of blockade and crimes against our country, they haven't been able to bow our people.\" He went on to say many things would change in Cuba, but only thanks to Cubans' own efforts and \"despite\" the United States. \"Perhaps that empire will collapse first,\" he added. He also slammed a recent ruling by a U.S. judge against a Cuban agent, but he said it was to be expected. \"Otherwise, the empire would cease to be the empire and Obama would cease to be stupid.\""

         "A devastated son whose father was beheaded and his mother abducted a week ago today said he now hopes she is dead to ‘ease her suffering’ as it is too unbearable to think of her in pain. Retired Russell Dermond’s decapitated body was found at his exclusive, lake-front home last Tuesday, but his wife of 62 years Shirley has vanished, in a suspected kidnapping. Investigators in Putnam County, Georgia are completely baffled by the gruesome crime and no one can understand why anyone would want to harm the beloved elderly couple. Nothing was taken from their $1m home, their car keys and cellphones were left behind. Scroll down for video . Unspeakable: Shirley Dermond, 87, has not been seen for more than a week after her husband's decapitated body was found at their home. Their son, Keith, said: 'If she is still alive, we can’t imagine . what she is going through… but it . has almost got to the stage where we hope she is with our father, just . to ease her suffering' Mystery: No-one has been able to think of why anyone would want to harm Shirley and Russell. Nothing was taken, their cellphones and car keys were left behind. Police have ruled out a mob hit and that Russell was in witness protection. And their family they can't believe it is linked to the drug murder of son, Mark, in 2000 . The police have been forced to deny they were taken out in a mob hit and their despairing family have also denied their is any link between the horror and the killing of one of the couple's son's in a drug deal gone wrong. Officers have been dredging a nearby lake and searching woods for clues, but as yet the local Sheriff says they have no leads. They still haven’t found 88-year-old Mr Dermond’s severed head. One of the Dermond’s three heartbroken children, Keith said the family had been wracking their brains to try to come up with any possible motive, but they say their parents didn’t have a single enemy in the world. He is still desperate for the safe return of his 87-year-old mother, but the idea of her suffering at the hands of a, ‘sick’ murderer is just too much for him to bear. Speaking to MailOnline, Keith, 55, from Jacksonville, Florida, said: ‘We are completely devastated, but our primary focus is finding our mother. The thought of her suffering is just unbearable. ‘Each hour that goes by, my brother, my sister and me are becoming more resigned to the fact that we may never see her again and we may never know what happened. ‘If she is still alive, we can’t imagine what she is going through. The human spirit is incredibly strong… but it has almost got to the stage where we hope she is with our father, just to ease her suffering. ‘Whoever did this was so sick in the head that I just can’t imagine it.’ Sick: Keith, pictured center left with wife Kathleen and other family members, said: 'The more we think about it, the more it makes sense that this was just some sick individual who randomly targeted them.' He added it could have been the work of a cult . Russell Dermond was last seen May 1 at a supermarket not far from his home in the gated Reynolds Plantation east of Atlanta. Shirley Dermond had started the next day’s newspaper crossword puzzle, but no one had taken the couple’s May 3 mail out of their mailbox. That same day, last Saturday, the Dermonds failed to show up at a friend’s Kentucky Derby party. According to Putnam County Sheriff, Howard Sills, financial and phone records have not turned up anything to suggest the Dermonds would be the target of criminal activity. Since the murder speculation about a potential motive has been rife. Sheriff Sills has been forced to deny rumors that Mr Dermond – whose body was found in his garage - was in a witness protection program and may have been killed by mobsters. He has also said there is no evidence that the brutal crime was in some way linked to the murder of the couple’s son Mark in a drug deal gone wrong in 2000. Mark was gunned down in Atlanta as he apparently tried to buy crack cocaine on his birthday. Troy Major was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment for murder. He was also hit with consecutive terms of 20 years for aggravated assault and five years for possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony. He has tried to appeal twice, but both attempts were denied. And Keith says that while his brother Brad, his sister Leslie and him have considered a possible link between their brother’s slaying and their father’s murder, It just doesn’t make sense. Isolated: Keith reckons they may have been targeted not because of their wealth - as they have richer neighbors either side, but because they live at the end of a cul-de-sac with no other houses that close . Discovery: Officers dredge a lake during the search for Shirley Dermond. Her body was found by a fisherman . He said: ‘People have tried to link this to my brother’s murder. We have obviously thought about that, because it is a violent connection to my parents, but that doesn’t make sense either. ‘The individual is still in jail and anyway, my parents weren’t really involved in the case at the time. They didn’t attend court, so if this was some kind of revenge, they would not be obvious targets. ‘It is a complete mystery as far as we are concerned. We have been wracking our brains trying to think of anyone who may have wanted to do this, but we have no idea. ‘My father hadn’t been in business for 20 years. He just spent his time relaxing and playing golf. He just didn’t have any enemies. ‘The more we think about it, the more it makes sense that this was just some sick individual who randomly targeted them. ‘My parents live at the end of a cul-de-sac, so they have no neighbors either side. Maybe that’s why they were targeted? ‘It could have been anything, something to do with a cult, we just don’t know. There were definitely people in that neighborhood who would be more obvious targets if it was a robbery. My parents were comfortable, but they definitely weren’t wealthy.’ Keith and his siblings initially flew to Georgia to try to help with the investigation, but they have not been allowed in the house - where many happy family parties were held over the years - because it is still a crime scene. Now they have returned home where they are playing an unbearable waiting game, desperately hoping for news about their mother one way or the other. And heartbreakingly, Sheriff Howard Sills has said he is not optimistic she’ll be found alive. Speaking on Tuesday, he said: ‘I’m running down one thing after another and coming up empty.’ There was speculation that an elderly woman who turned up dazed and confused Monday at a Tampa hospital was Shirley Dermond, but that has been completely dismissed. Concern: The alarm was raised when the couple failed to turn up to a Kentucky Derby party . And Sills said rumors of organized crime involvement are unfounded. He said: ‘No, the man wasn’t in witness protection. He wasn’t going to testify. There’s no evidence of any kind of torture.’ On Tuesday, they enlisted the aid of a Department of Natural Resources submarine robot to scour the deep peninsula off Lake Oconee outside the couple’s home. So far, they’ve turned up nothing. Sills said he had also dispatched deputies to a wooded area near the crime scene in the hope they would discover some kind of clue. Keith – who like his late father, manages a chain of restaurants - said: ‘The Sheriff is keeping us informed as much as he can. I spoke to him yesterday. He is holding back some information as it is important to the case. ‘The house is still a crime scene, they are looking for finger prints and dredging the lake, but there just doesn’t seem to be much in terms of leads.’ He added: ‘My parents were married for 62 years. Family was everything to them. Their happiest times were spent with us, that’s what they loved doing. We just pray someone who knows something comes forward and puts an end to all of this.’"

Three members of the same family who died in a static caravan from carbon monoxide poisoning would have been unconscious 'within minutes', investigators said today. The bodies of married couple John and Audrey Cook were discovered alongside their daughter, Maureen, at the mobile home they shared on Tremarle Home Park in Camborne, west Cornwall. The inquests have now opened into the deaths last Saturday, with investigators saying the three died along with the family's pet dog, of carbon monoxide poisoning from a cooker. Tragic: The inquests have opened into the deaths of three members of the same family who were found in their static caravan last weekend. John and Audrey Cook are pictured . Awful: The family died following carbon monoxide poisoning at this caravan at the Tremarle Home Park in Camborne, Cornwall . It is also believed there was no working carbon monoxide detector in the static caravan. Cornwall Fire and Rescue Service said this would have resulted in the three being unconscious 'within minutes', . A spokesman for Cornwall coroner Dr Emma Carlyon confirmed the inquests were opened and adjourned yesterday afternoon. They will resume at a later date. Devon and Cornwall Police confirmed on Monday that carbon monoxide poisoning had been established as the cause of death. A police spokesman said the source of the poisoning was 'believed to be from incorrect operation of the gas cooker'. Poisoning: This woman left flowers outside the caravan following the deaths. It has emerged that the trio would have been unconscious 'within minutes' Touching: This tribute was left outside the caravan following news of the deaths . Early readings from experts at the site revealed a potentially lethal level of carbon monoxide present within the caravan at the time it was taken, shortly after the discovery of the bodies. Friends and neighbours have paid tribute to the trio. One . neighbour, Sonya Owen, 53, said: 'It's very distressing. I knew the . daughter, she was living her with her mum and dad. Everybody is really . upset.' Margaret Holmes, 65, who lived near the couple and their . daughter, said: 'They had lived here for around 40 years and they kept . themselves to themselves. 'I just can’t believe this has . happened, it is so sad and I am so shocked, I think we all are, you just . don’t expect this sort of thing to happen on your doorstep. 'Everyone will miss them, we used to chat a lot when we were both in the garden. 'I would just like to send my condolences to their family, I can’t imagine what they’re going through.' Nic Clark, 52, who was good friends with daughter Maureen, added: 'They were a lovely kind family, a great trio. 'Maureen . used to go out and walk her dog, a little Jack Russell, it is so sad . what has happened, I understand the dog went with them. 'They . will be sorely missed and I think everyone is just in shock at the . moment, I would like to send my condolences to the Cook family.'",

         "UNITED NATIONS (CNN) -- A rare meeting of U.N. Security Council heads of state, led for the first time by a U.S. president, adopted a resolution focused on stopping the spread of nuclear weapons Thursday. President Obama is the first U.S. leader to head a United Nations Security Council meeting. President Obama challenged the gathering -- which included leaders of nuclear powers including Russia, China, Great Britain and France -- to overcome cynicism against the goal of ridding the planet of nuclear arms. \"We harbor no illusions about the difficulty of bringing about a world without nuclear weapons,\" Obama said, adding that Thursday's meeting signaled a significant step forward in cooperative global action. The resolution, which was adopted unanimously, calls for tighter controls on nuclear materials to prevent them from being used for military purposes or stolen. It also encourages enforcement of international treaties and U.N. resolutions regarding nuclear non-proliferation, particularly when nations such as Iran and North Korea are in violation. \"The world must stand together,\" Obama said. \"We must demonstrate that international law is not an empty promise.\" It was the first Security Council summit chaired by a U.S. president, and only the fifth time that Security Council heads of state have met. Obama led the meeting because the United States holds the revolving presidency of the Security Council in September. Both Obama and Russian President Dimitry Medvedev, who spoke later, said the world's two nuclear superpowers were working on reducing their stockpiles in advance of a global nuclear summit scheduled for next year. \"It's obvious that an effective solution ... depends on the constructive engagement of all parties,\" Medvedev said, adding that he expected the Russia-U.S. leadership on the issue to be backed by \"all nuclear powers.\" The measure passed Thursday -- Security Council resolution 1887 -- calls for \"locking down vulnerable nuclear weapons materials in four years\" while minimizing civilian use of weapons-grade uranium. It encourages full compliance with all international treaties and resolutions on nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament, including Security Council resolutions that cite North Korea and Iran for failing to adhere to international commitments. In addition, the resolution supports the peaceful use of nuclear energy, a theme backed by Chinese President Hu Jintao. China seeks to expand its nuclear energy capacity as part of an economic development plan that holds down greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change. British Prime Minister Gordon Brown also cited the role of nuclear power as a clean energy source that should be part of the solution to global warming affecting every nation. Brown and other leaders spoke of the need to prevent nuclear weapons or the materials to make them from ending up in the hands of terrorist groups. \"The biggest risk the world faces today is of extremists getting hold of nuclear materials,\" said Mohammad ElBaradei, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency. Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, who criticized the Security Council on Wednesday in a rambling speech to the U.N. General Assembly, was absent for the meeting. In Libya's turn to speak at the summit, its special representative to the United Nations called for the IAEA to inspect all nuclear programs, including Israel's, instead of focusing on non-nuclear states. Asked later about Gadhafi's absence, White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said Libya could serve as an example to Iran and North Korea as a nation that gave up its nuclear weapons program and now had rejoined the full international community. \"I think the message that the Libyans had at the Security Council is a message that we hope that the Iranians and the North Koreans will take to heart, and that is giving up a nuclear weapons program and the benefits that it can have for international cooperation and for their reintegration into an international community,\" Gibbs said. Brown earlier called for sanctions against Iran for its efforts to develop a nuclear weapon. On Wednesday, Medvedev signaled that Russia -- which previously has opposed such move -- also could support sanctions against Iran. \"Russia's position is clear: sanctions rarely lead to productive results, but in some cases sanctions are inevitable,\" Medvedev said in a joint appearance with Obama after they met in New York. The statement bolsters U.S.-led efforts for increased international pressure on Iran to adhere to nonproliferation agreements in pursuing the development of nuclear energy. Iran claims its nuclear program is intended for peaceful purposes, but the international community accuses it of continuing to try to develop nuclear weapons capability. The Iranian mission to the United Nations released a statement after the Security Council meeting, saying the country's nuclear activities \"are and always have been, for peaceful purposes, and, therefore, pose no threat whatsoever.\" \"In practicing its legitimate right to develop nuclear energy technology, Iran has always maintained its need for nuclear power as an alternative source of energy to supply its booming population and rapid development. ... Our commitment to nonproliferation remains intact,\" the statement added. The United States and Russia previously have disagreed over Iran, and over possible steps the Security Council may take -- including imposing sanctions -- to push Tehran to comply with U.N. demands concerning its nuclear program. Last week, Obama announced that the United States was dropping plans to base a missile defense shield system in Poland and the Czech Republic, a proposal that had rankled Moscow. He has denied the change was directly linked to Russia's position regarding sanctions on Iran, but said any Russian shift in that direction would be a bonus.",

         "Cover-up: Former Archbishop Lord Hope allowed a paedophile priest to escape punishment for sex crimes, a judge's report claims . A former archbishop who failed to act on alleged crimes of a paedophile priest should be jailed, the abuser’s victims have said. Lord Hope, the former Archbishop of York, did not act on 19 occasions when allegations of abuse or inappropriate conduct by the priest were raised with him, a scathing report revealed yesterday. But despite that, Lord Hope remains as an honorary assistant bishop in the Diocese of Bradford. Eli Ward and Bim Atkinson, who were among seven victims of the Very Reverend Robert Waddington, former Dean of Manchester, said it is ‘incredible’ that the man who did nothing to stop the priest has been allowed to keep his post. The report by Judge Sally Cahill QC said Lord Hope failed to act because his ‘concern for the welfare of Robert Waddington seems to have been paramount’. Waddington, who kept an official position in the church until 2005 and died in 2007, targeted young choirboys over several decades. One of the seven victims committed suicide in 1989. Mr Atkinson, 59, who was abused when Waddington was a priest in Australia in the 1960s, sent a picture of disgraced Tory peer Lord Archer, who was jailed for perjury, to the Bishop of North Queensland Bill Ray, adding: ‘I would be pushing for Lord Hope to be treated in the same way as this fellow.’ Mr Ward, now 41, was abused by Waddington between the ages of 11 and 15 as a chorister at Manchester Cathedral. He said: ‘It’s just incredible Lord Hope still has a position. Here is a guy who shoved it all under the carpet. 'He failed and failed to do anything and yet nothing has happened to him. He is still allowed to sit in the House of Lords.’ He added: ‘I’d like to see him punished. My opinion is that he’s committed a crime, perverting the course of justice, and should face the consequences.’ Robert Waddington died in 2007 - he had been accused of abusing seven different victims between 1955 and 1996 . Mr Ward said he left the choir when he was 15 after church officials became concerned – but the priest was allowed to remain as the dean in charge of the cathedral until 1993. Waddington then moved to York Minster, where more children were abused. He stayed in a lesser post there until 2005, despite the allegations made to Lord Hope, according to the report, which was commissioned by current Archbishop of York, the Most Reverend John Sentamu. Mr Ward said: ‘Here we had a church body which had been preaching at us to be morally correct yet, when it came to doing the same thing themselves, they were incapable.’ Mr Ward, now living in the Home Counties with a long-term girlfriend, added that he has put the abuse behind him. But he believes Waddington’s abuse was responsible for the death of another victim, a former chorister from Carlisle named in the report only as Peter, who was abused in the 1970s, developed depression and schizophrenia, and committed suicide in 1989. Lord Hope, 76, has described Judge Cahill’s report as ‘flawed’ but offered a ‘personal and profound apology’. He said: ‘This report makes it clear that not applying the policy is not the same as a cover-up. Hindsight is a wonderful thing.’",

TLC has pulled an episode of Cake Boss from future screening schedules after receiving complaints over the show's mishandling of a transgender guest star. The episode, which aired on Monday night, showed transgender Carmen Carerra, 27, who was born as a man, take part in a stunt that she believed was edited to look distasteful. The stunt involved Buddy 'Cake Boss' Valastro, the reality show's star, tricking Anthony 'Cousin Anthony' Bellifemine into believing that Miss Carerra was born as a woman. Controversy: TLC have halted all future airings of Monday night's episode of Cake Boss which featured a transgender woman (right) and one of the show's stars Anthony Bellifemine (left), after receiving complaints . Surprise: Mr Bellifemine (right) was shocked by news that Carmen Carrera was born a man. The reaction later turns to disgust and he threatens to leave the bar they had been partying in . After the episode aired, Miss Carerra, a . former star of the reality series RuPaul's Drag Race, wrote on her Facebook page that she believed the show turned her involvement into a . 'Jerry Springer, \"THAT'S A MAN\" kind of thing'. The New Jersey-based transgender woman claimed that she had signed onto the show as an example of how 'a beautiful transgendered woman' can get 'hit on at a bar' and 'IT'S OK!'. Glamour: Miss Carerra, seen above in New York on February 3, rose to fame as a contestant on the reality TV show RuPaul's Drag Race . Fans of Miss Carerra wrote on her Facebook page about their disappointment over the show. One person wrote: 'This whole thing sucks... you are so beautiful and talented. You don't need to build your career on being a victim.' Another wrote: 'The last time I checked transgender meant born in the wrong body... so my final statement is . \"YOU ARE A FULL BLOWN, VERY REAL WOMAN!\".' TLC told the Los Angeles Times: 'TLC can confirm that the episode was immediately removed from rotation after learning of Carmen Carrera and her supporters' concerns, and the network is reviewing the content to see whether it could be reintroduced following edits.' Repeats of the episode did not run but the network added that the episode may air again without the controversial scene. During the episode, Mr Valastro is . seen telling the cameras: 'We had this really pretty girl set up and he .  went hook, line and sinker, he didn't even look at any . other girls. He went right for her.' Footage . then shows Miss Carrerra flirting with Mr Bellifemine in a bar as the . pair down shots of liquor and she even gives him a peck on the cheek. Mr Valastro . later reveals that she was in fact born as a man, news that Mr . Bellifemine is shown to be clearly unimpressed by as he is shown . threatening to leave the party in disgust. Producers . on the show even show footage of the reactions of onlookers in the bar, . as they attempt to depict horror spreading throughout the entire scene . as a result of the reveal. Mr Valastro tells the cameras: 'So . Carmen was all about having fun and pranking Anthony, she loves little . pranks like this... Carmen loved the fact that they thought she was . attractive.' He adds: 'That's a man, baby!' The . guest star is seen telling the cameras later in the scene: 'Listen, it . was so easy to get Anthony. Ladies out there, all you need to do is . dress really, really cute and put on some pink lip gloss and Anthony . will be all over you.' Joker: Buddy 'Cake Boss' Valastro is shown to have set up the stunt and says: 'Carmen loves little pranks' Trick: Miss Carerra (right) is shown flirting with Mr Bellifemine (left) who is unaware that she was born a man . Chemistry: Mr Bellifemine is clearly taken by the woman, posing for a picture with her for an onlooker . Miss Carerra wrote after viewing the episode: 'LET ME MAKE THIS VERY CLEAR! LISTEN UP PEOPLE! I signed on to do this . episode of Cake Boss to promote EQUALITY. Transgender women are just . as beautiful as biological woman and should be respected for that.' She continued: 'The reveal was never meant to be a \"Jerry . Springer, THAT'S A MAN...\" kind of thing. I was promised that it wasn't . going to be that way. I was lied to. I don't promote misleading someone . or putting down the trans community. I am a beautiful transgendered . woman and if a guy hits on me at a bar, ITS OK! That was the message. 'Hearing things like \"You'll never be a real woman\"... is the . EXACT TYPE OF IGNORANCE THAT THIS SHOW HELPED TO PROMOTE,' she wrote. ' This is why I'm . so upset. If men find me attractive and treat me as a lady, why do some . of you people think it's wrong??? Why are some of you trying to take that . away from me like I dont deserve to be treated with respect and . admiration? Ignorance, that's why. STOP THE HATE AND PASS THIS ON.' Disgust: The subject of the prank is immediately turned off Miss Carerra when he learns her secret . Onlookers: The episode even includes footage of other bar goers (above) looking on in shock . Unaware: Miss Carerra (right) claimed she did not know the prank would treat her sexuality with insensitivity . She even launched a petition on the website Change.org in an attempt to receive an apology from TLC over the representation. It reads: 'Before filming, Carmen educated . producers on what terms to use and what phrases would not be offensive, . i.e. \"Carmen was BORN male\" or \"Carmen is a transgendered woman\". Producers AGREED to respect her wishes, however, when the show aired it . was a blatant \"THAT'S A MAN\" moment.' The petition received more than 8,800 signatures.",

         "'The lamps are going out all over Europe. We shall not see them lit again in our lifetime' Foreign Secretary Sir Edward Grey, August 3, 1914 . Prime Minister David Cameron is urging Britons to switch off their lights for an hour tomorrow evening to mark the 100th anniversary of Britain’s declaration of war on Germany in 1914. The Lights Out initiative will be the culmination of a day of commemorative events across the country and in Europe, with members of the Royal Family fully involved at home and abroad. Millions of homes, offices and public and private buildings, such as Tower Bridge and 10 Downing Street, will be included in the ‘shared moment of reflection’ between 10pm and 11pm, leaving just a single candle or bulb illuminating a window as a symbol of ‘continuing hope in the darkness’. The initiative was inspired by then Foreign Secretary Sir Edward Grey’s remark at the outbreak of the First World War: ‘The lamps are going out all over Europe. We shall not see them lit again in our lifetime.’ Mr Cameron told The Mail on Sunday: ‘Lights Out is a way for everyone to mark the First World War centenary and I would encourage people to take part and turn off their lights tomorrow at 10pm for an hour, apart from a single light or candle. ‘This will be a personal gesture in remembrance of all those who made the ultimate sacrifice for us 100 years ago. They must never be forgotten.’ The national commemorations will begin with a morning service of prayers, hymns and readings in Glasgow Cathedral linked to the conclusion of the Commonwealth Games. The event will be attended by Commonwealth leaders, Mr Cameron and Prince Charles. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will attend a remembrance service in Liege, Belgium, before joining Prince Harry and Mr Cameron for a commemoration organised by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission in Mons, where the first and last British soldiers who died on the Western Front are buried. At 10pm, to coincide with the start of the ‘Lights Out’ initiative, a vigil service will be held at Westminster Abbey during which members of the congregation will extinguish candles until there is just one left alight on the tomb of the unknown soldier, which will be snuffed out by the Duchess of Cornwall. Scroll down for video . Poignant: Young drummers in Sandhurst, Berkshire, will lead a special service . During the day, there will be a number of Church of England services attended by other members of the Royal family including the Queen, who will be at Balmoral in Scotland, and Prince Philip, at Sandringham in Norfolk. Other special events will be held up and down the UK, including a commemorative service led by Sandhurst and District Corps of Drums in Berkshire. Labour’s spokesman on the First World War commemorations, Dan Jarvis, said: ‘With the busy lives we lead today, the simple act of pausing, switching off the lights and lighting a candle will be a very powerful tribute.’",

         "Roy Hodgson has come under fire for making public Raheem Sterling's admission that he was feeling tired ahead of England's Euro 2016 qualifier with Estonia. The Liverpool star told the England manager that he was too fatigued to start the match in Tallinn after shouldering a heavy burden this season for both club and country. Hodgson then made Sterling's comments public ahead of the match, which England won 1-0 thanks to Wayne Rooney's second-half free-kick. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Roy Hodgson: Raheem came to me complaining of tiredness . England manager Roy Hodgson was criticised for making public Raheem Sterling's admission that he was feeling tired ahead of Sunday's Euro 2016 win over Estonia . Sterling did not make England's starting XI in Tallinn but came on as a second-half substitute . Sterling was replaced by his Liverpool teammate Adam Lallana in the starting line-up but came on as a second-half substitute. Sky Sports pundits and former Liverpool players Jamie Redknapp and Jamie Carragher both criticised Hodgson for not keeping their conversation private. Redknapp said: 'I would never have dreamed of saying that  to an England manager, but then I picked up a lot of injuries. 'I'm sure Brendan Rodgers would have been leaning on him,  you need a break and this is an opportunity to get one. 'Why on earth did Hodgson say it though? Honesty is not the best policy. Why has Roy got into this? He could have said 'I want to freshen this up.' This wouldn't even be a conversation.' Sky Sports pundit Jamie Redknapp said Hodgson should have kept the conversation with Sterling private . Jamie Carragher, also talking on Sky Sports, agreed that Hodgson should have used more discretion . Carragher agreed that discretion would have been a better idea: 'Me as a player, I would never give a manager a chance to leave me out. 'But keep it between yourselves, just come out and say Lallana played well last game and say Raheem needs a rest. But now we are having a debate on it. 'Hodgson could have been more careful, but I don't think Rodgers would have been involved.' Sterling, 19, came off the bench to win the 74th-minute free-kick that led to England skipper Rooney curled in for his 43rd international goal. Hodgson said after the game: 'People don't like it when you simplistically tell the truth. We were training at The Grove doing a light session but some work in how we wanted to play the game tactically. Hodgson chats to Sterling during training on the eve of the match in Tallinn, which England won 1-0 . Sterling's Liverpool teammate Adam Lallana started in his place in the England midfield diamond . 'Just before we started, Raheem had done the warm up and he came to me and said ''look I really am feeling a bit tired, I'm not in my best form at the moment because I am feeling a bit tired''. 'So I said best thing is Adam Lallana starts the game and you rest and I have got you to bring on from the bench, simple as that. 'As you saw when he came on there is nothing wrong with him and he isn't suffering from anything. 'It was a question of having two players, who both did pretty well against San Marino and one is telling me he is a bit tired and jaded, the other one is full of beans. 'We'll put the one on who is full of beans and keep the other one up your sleeve. 'I think it would be wrong of players to try to fool me into think they are ready and that they're 100 per cent when they aren't because they are robbing somebody else of an opportunity. I thought Lallana had a good game.'",

         "Every frontline police officer should be offered a Taser to help fight the threat from lone-wolf terrorists, a police leader declared yesterday. Steve White, who chairs the Police Federation, said evidence of plans to murder officers made the move necessary. ‘The terrorist ideal to get attention no longer relies on an attack being in a place of note,’ he said. ‘It could be in Cheam high street, in any town, in any part of the UK. We know there are more dangerous people out there, preparing to attack police officers and we need to be able to respond to that threat.’ Steve White, who chairs the Police Federation, said evidence of plans to murder officers made it necessary for every frontline officer to be offered a taser . Leaders of the Police Federation are set to vote next month about whether every uniformed officer should be offered training in the use of a Taser . The terrorist threat level for police was raised to severe two weeks ago in the wake of the Paris atrocity and a foiled assault on officers in Belgium. Since then, police chiefs and junior officers have been considering how to counter the extra dangers. Last December, a threat was made to kidnap and kill a policeman in the West Midlands. Officers were given extra security briefings and urged not to travel to work in uniform. Leaders of the Police Federation, which represents rank-and-file officers, will vote next month on a proposal that every uniformed frontline officer should be offered training in the use of Tasers, though some may choose not to carry them. The weapons, which carry an electric current of up to 50,000 volts to incapacitate dangerous suspects, have been linked to at least ten deaths in England and Wales over the past decade. Some senior officers are believed to support the idea in theory, but one police leader said chief constables would be mostly opposed. The police chief, speaking anonymously, told the Guardian: ‘The idea of arming every police officer with a Taser is alien to 200 years of police culture. It is a stepping stone to arming the police – something strapped to your hip that looks like a firearm is a huge shift in what we stand for.’",

         "By . Dan Bloom . It's one very, very small step for man - but a giant leap for antkind. Around 800 common ants, usually found pattering across pavements and picnics, have been sent to the International Space Station to teach scientists how they move in low gravity. Eight colonies each about the size of a tablet computer have been set up to teach experts how to build robots which interact with each other. Welcome: Nasa astronaut Rick Mastracchio greets 800 new friends aboard the International Space Station. Scientists will study how ants work together in low gravity and copy their methods to develop robots . Small steps: Each of the eight colonies is the size of a tablet computer and can be expanded to examine how the insects work together in different-sized environments . As the colonies are expanded, the ants move from small circles to straight lines to cover more ground . Houseguests: The colonies were delivered alongside Christmas presents for ISS astronauts . It is because ants inside colonies move according to internalised rules, judging how many other ants are nearby by touching antenna and using their sense of smell. Working together, the ants cover a piece of ground comprehensively to find food and supplies. When the area expands they change from moving in small circles to scuttling in straighter lines, covering more ground. But in the micro gravity of space, the ants' rules are confounded and they have to develop a new set of innate principles by which to work. These flexible principles could then be adapted to instruct robots to work together in the same way, for tasks like searching a burning building. Video cameras are trained on the experiment and images of the pavement ants, as they are known, are being beamed back to Earth. Close-up: The images will be beamed back to Earth. Pictured: Nasa flight engineer Mike Hopkins . Significant: The experiment could help develop robots which search disaster zones or burning buildings . These will be monitored by students at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas, and compared to a similar colony in their classroom. Stefanie Countryman, a professor at Bioserve Space Technologies, the private firm which launched the mission, told Bionews Texas: 'When ant densities are high, each ant thoroughly searches one small area in a circular, â€˜randomâ€™ walk. 'When ant densities are low, each ant searches by walking in a relatively straight line, allowing it to cover more ground.' The unusual cargo was delivered by an unmanned supply rocket this week which also included 28 mini-satellites known as Doves. Each less than 2ft across, they contain ultra high definition cameras which could track crop harvests, climate change and natural disasters like wildfires and floods. The cargo also included Christmas presents for those aboard the International Space Station - which were supposed to be delivered last month. The ants' launch had to be delayed several times after emergency repairs, America's 'polar vortex' of cold weather and a strong solar storm all intervened.",

         "Workers digging an underground garage for a new hotel recently struck something big about 30 feet below the surface. This week they uncovered it - a boulder that's thousands of years old and bigger than an SUV, weighing an estimated 150 tons or 300,000lbs. A geotechnical engineer who was called out to examine the giant rock in Everett, Washington. The rock, which weighs 150 tons and is bigger than an SUV was discovered in Everett, Washington. It is believed that a glacier left the 'erratic rock' there around 18,000 years ago . An excavator digs around a glacial erratic rock discovered at the Courtyard by Marriott construction site last Thursday and then fully unearthed on Wednesday . The rock is bigger than an SUV and close to 19 feet long and 10 feet wide, The Daily Herald reported. Several drill bits were broken due to the rock. Geotechnical expert Kurt Merriman, told The Daily Herald it's a glacial erratic - a giant rock left behind by a glacier. maybe 18,000 years ago. It is likely that the boulder traveled from northern Canada or Alaska, the engineer said. The site superintendent for the Halvorson Construction Group, Ben Hansen, said it may give the boulder to the city to try to find it a home. Work on the new Courtyard by Marriot hotel was suspended following the fascinating find. A glacial erratic is a piece of rock that is totally different from the size and type of rock in the area where it has been found. 'Erratics' are normally carried by glacial ice, often over distances of hundreds of kilometers. Glacial erratics can range from pebbles to one of the largest ever found in Alberta, Canada. Big Rock as it is known weighs 16,500 tons. Who left that there?

         "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- People in big cities walk past them every day -- street performers, or buskers. Some are talented, some are not, and most aren't performing for a cause greater than themselves. But on Monday, 12-year-old Abby Miller was. Abby Miller sings for her friend Taylor Love outside Washington's Union Station on Monday. She was performing outside Washington's Union Station to help her 4-year-old friend, Taylor Love, who is suffering from cancer. Abby sat in front of the station with a couple of her friends, singing songs and strumming a guitar. Passers-by seemed to notice the girl's singing talent, stopping to listen in the chilly weather, with a few putting money in a bucket at Abby's feet. Abby said the money will help support Taylor's family. A few more stopped to write messages on \"Love Notes,\" little cards designed to encourage Taylor Love through the tough time. \"Her mom reads them to her before she goes to bed at night,\" Abby said. \"Taylor gets excited for them and she loves getting them read to her because she likes knowing that people are supporting her and people are actually thinking of her.\" Taylor has neuroblastoma, a cancer that affects the nervous system. According to her Web site, she is in remission, but this type of cancer has a high risk of recurrence. There has been little research on the illness, of which there are about 650 new cases in the United States each year. Mike Gillette, a family friend of both Taylor and Abby, brought the two girls together. While raising money and support for Taylor is important, he said, he thinks Abby's outreach can help bring more critical awareness for the devastating disease. \"She really wanted to reach people all over the country,\" he said. Gillette said he has taken Abby to do similar performances in the District of Columbia, New Jersey and Virginia, and estimates they've raised thousands of dollars and have gotten people to write several hundred \"Love Notes.\" Abby does more than just raise money and awareness for her friend. Taylor's mother, Aimee, said that although Abby is eight years older than Taylor, the two see each other often and have a special connection that helps her get through her daughter's illness. \"I think it's amazing for a 12-year-old Abby to be drawn to my daughter, who is 4 and wants to inspire other children,\" Aimee Love said. \"The joy I see in Taylor when she sees Abby brings a light into my life.\" Taylor's family said her treatments are terribly painful. But Abby said Taylor has enormous character. \"She's the most happy girl in the world, which I think is just incredible,\" Abby said. \"She's so much fun to be around. She's a little 4-year-old girl but she's got a heart of like a thousand grown adults.\" Aimee Love said her daughter feels the same way about Abby. \"It gives her someone to aspire to, someone to be inspired by,\" she said.",

         "Denise Shepherd, 19, who died from an overdose of heroin and a cocktail of pills after becoming addicted to drugs aged 11 . A teenage girl died from an overdose of heroin and a cocktail of pills after becoming addicted to drugs when she was aged just 11, an inquest has heard. Denise Shepherd started smoking cannabis before starting secondary school and then progressed to harder drugs such as heroin. In June last year, aged 19, she was found dead in the flat she shared with her boyfriend Jamie Hayne in Eastbourne, East Sussex, when he woke in the early hours of the morning and found she had stopped breathing. At an inquest into her death at Eastbourne Magistrate's Court, her mother Joann Bell told the coroner how her daughter had moved into her flat in a bid to get her to stop taking drugs but was later joined by Mr Hayne. The pair were said to be drinking heavily and were suspected of taking drugs. However, two days before Miss Shepherd, who was unemployed, was found dead, Ms Bell moved out of the flat. She said her daughter and Mr Hayne had a volatile relationship and didn't clean up after themselves. She said: 'They became increasingly difficult to live with. 'I struggled financially because they came to me for food.' She also told the hearing how her daughter had smoked cannabis from a very early age after she had 'fallen in with the wrong crowd'. Coronor Alan Craze was also told how a neighbour had tried to administer CPR to Miss Shepherd when she was discovered unconscious. When paramedics arrived they too were unable to revive her and it is feared she may have been dead for some time. Mr Craze then recorded a verdict of death due to a dependence on drugs. The inquest at Eastbourne Magistrates Court, pictured, saw Coroner Alan Craze record a verdict of death due to a dependence on drugs . Speaking after the inquest, Ms Bell said she has tried to warn her daughter about the dangers of drugs. She said: 'It is so difficult. People won’t talk to their parents about drugs. 'I tried to sit down and talk to her calmly but I never was aware exactly what was going on. 'I wouldn’t have moved out if I had known. 'She was gullible, naive and easily-led. 'She would be an aunty now. Her brother is now a father. She would have loved being an aunty.'",

         "Las Vegas (CNN) -- The makers of Gorilla Glass, the glass that's used in touchscreen gadgets such as iPhones, iPads and more than 500 other models of electronic gadgets, has officially unveiled a thinner and more touch-sensitive version of their product. When it comes to innovation in electronic gadgets, a new kind of glass is not especially sexy. But when that glass is built into millions of touchscreen devices, and could potentially make them thinner, lighter and more responsive to your finger, consumers may take notice. Corning Inc. says Gorilla Glass 2 is thinner and more touch-sensitive without sacrificing toughness or resistance to scratches. The company showed off the glass Monday at a gadget-showcase event at the International Consumer Electronics Show here and is showing live demos of its enhanced qualities at the Corning booth throughout the four-day show. The new glass is not any less resistant to breakage than the current Gorilla Glass, which may be disappointing news to anyone who has had to put up with a cracked screen after dropping a phone. \"It's not scratch-proof. And if they drop it on granite, it can be broken,\" said Corning general manager Clifford Hund. But he added that Corning has managed to make the glass 20% thinner but just as strong -- a key advancement at a time when smartphone and tablet makers are trying to produce ever-thinner devices. The second generation of Gorilla Glass will debut in Windows-based PCs this year. Other manufacturers also are weighing how and when to add the glass to their upcoming devices, Hund said. Because it's thinner -- about 0.8 millimeters instead of 1 millimeter -- the glass allows users' fingers to be closer to the touch interface, creating a screen that responds more quickly and accurately, said Gorilla Glass program director Jaymin Amin. The glass also has been engineered to let more light through, creating a brighter display screen, Corning executives said. Due to customer nondisclosure agreements, Corning cannot name all the devices that use Gorilla Glass -- including Apple products. But according to multiple other sources, including Walter Isaacson's recent biography of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, the product's first consumer application was the original iPhone in 2007. A passage from Isaacson's book details how Apple had originally planned to use plastic display coverings for its iPhone before Jobs approached Corning CEO Wendell Weeks about ordering glass instead. Weeks told him Corning had developed a tough form of glass, made extra strong by a chemical process, but couldn't find a market for it. Weeks didn't think Corning could manufacture the glass fast enough to meet Apple's timetable for the iPhone launch. But at the prodding of Jobs, who wouldn't take no for an answer, Corning did it in six months. After the iPhone hit the market, Jobs sent Weeks a note that said, \"We couldn't have done it without you.\" Gorilla Glass also is part of touchscreens in electronic devices by Acer, Asus, Dell, HTC, LG, Motorola, Nokia, Samsung and Sony, among other manufacturers. Amin demonstrated its toughness Monday by placing a small square of the original glass in a lever press, then applying more than 100 pounds of pressure onto it. Despite looking like he was truly exerting himself, he couldn't break it. Amin then tested the new glass the same way and got the same result.",

         "(CNN)The Red Bull Formula One team has had its trophy cabinet cleared out by thieves in a smash-and-grab burglary Friday night. The British-based marque has won 50 grands prix, four constructor titles and four drivers' world championships in its 10-year history. The spoils of this success had been on display in the reception to its factory, which is based on an industrial estate in Milton Keynes, England. \"We are obviously devastated by this serious factory break-in, which saw offenders drive a vehicle through our front entrance and steal more than 60 trophies which took years and hard work to accumulate,\" Red Bull team principal Christian Horner said in a statement. \"The break in caused significant damage and was very upsetting for our night officers who were on duty at the time. \"Beyond the aggressive nature of this break in, we are perplexed why anyone would take these trophies. \"The value to the team is of course extraordinarily high due to the sheer hard work and effort that went into winning each and every one. But their intrinsic value is low; they would be of little benefit to those outside of the team and, in addition to that, many of the trophies on display were replicas.\" Smash and grab . Thames Valley Police are investigating the incident which took place just before 01:30 Friday. A statement by the police, who are appealing for witnesses, detailed the robbery was carried out by around six men. \"Two cars were involved in the burglary,\" the statement added. \"A silver 4x4 which was used to drive through the entrance and a further dark colored, black or dark blue Mercedes estate car. Both are believed to have foreign number plates.\" Red Bull said it would be review access to its factory following the incident.

         "Los Angeles (CNN) -- \"Teflon Don\" rapper Rick Ross crashed his silver Rolls Royce into an apartment building after he heard gunfire along a Fort Lauderdale, Florida, street Monday morning, police said. \"The driver of the Rolls Royce attempted to drive away from the direction of the shots being fired and lost control of the vehicle, striking a nearby apartment building,\" Fort Lauderdale Police Detective DeAnna Garcia said. Ross and a female passenger were not hurt by the wreck or the gunshots, Garcia said. \"The suspects fled from the area prior to police arrival,\" she said. The incident, however, called attention to threats against the artist's life made in a street gang's videos and posted online in recent months. \"We're pulling up on you,\" a man who identified himself as a member of the Gangster Disciples warned in one of the videos. \"Whatever city, whatever state, the pressure on.\" Several videos purporting to be from Gangster Disciple members in several states -- including Georgia, North Carolina and Florida -- appeared on YouTube late last year demanding that Ross pay a fee to them for his use of the Star of David, which they claim as a gang symbol, and a reference to one of their founders in his music and marketing. \"You got to cut the check,\" one video said. \"Tell your boss man he got to get that check, or all you in trouble.\" \"We need that cash right now,\" another said. Ross, 37, whose albums include \"Teflon Don\" in 2010 and \"Deeper Than Rap\" a year earlier, told south Florida radio station 99 Jamz last month that he was not intimidated by the threats. \"Ain't never no checks getting cut,\" he said. \"I don't play those games. I consider that extortion.\" Is Nas hip-hop's finest MC? Ross did cancel his North Carolina shows last month just days after a video appeared online threatening his life if he performed there. \"Never was it due to any threats,\" he told the radio station. Instead, he canceled because \"the promoter wasn't really handling his business.\" Ross wanted to make certain that listeners understood he was not frightened. \"Don't ever get it twisted, Ricky Ross is the boss,\" he said. The death threats are not the only challenge to Ross. A former drug lord and gang leader is suing in a Los Angeles court, accusing him of stealing his name and reputation. \"The reality is I want justice done,\" the original Ross wrote in an e-mail to CNN. \"I know that he took his name and image from my life and believe he is unfairly profiting off my story.\" Ricky \"Freeway\" Ross was serving a prison sentence a decade ago when rapper William Roberts, who previously worked as a Florida correctional officer, adopted \"Rick Ross\" as his stage name, according to the lawsuit. \"This rapper and his labels clearly knew of my name and story, and have tried to suck out the lifeblood without license,\" the former drug lord said. \"I have my own use for my intellectual property and did not need this confusion created.\" More recently, the rapper has been using the name \"Ricky Rozay.\" The rapper and his record label have not responded to CNN's request for comment. Despite the death threats and legal issues, his music is doing well. Ross is nominated for a best rap album Grammy for his latest release, \"God Forgives, I Don't.\" CNN's Marlena Baldacci contributed to this report.",

         "By . Bianca London . Just two days ago Kate Moss was unveiling her hotly anticipated collection for Topshop but there's no rest for the world's most famous supermodel. Aside from her fashion designing duties, 40-year-old Kate has been quietly creating a new beauty range for Rimmel London. The colourful collection of mascaras, lipsticks, eyeliners and nail varnish is bound to brighten up the nation's make-up bags this season and Kate shows us how to work the season's best beauty trends in the new campaign imagery. Does she ever stop? Kate Moss has unveiled a new beauty range for Rimmel London and models the colour-popping shades in the new imagery . Kate, who has been working with the beauty giant for several years, has created her first-ever eye collection called Idol Eyes - a fitting name for the world-famous supermodel. Speaking about the range, which includes glimmering hues of pink, green, blue and black mascaras, she said: 'My new Idol Eyes Collection was inspired by my favourite gem stones and jewels. 'The intense authentic shades of mascara, eye colour and liner are perfect for creating either a statement or more subtle eye look.' Kate has also created four shadow sticks, which aim to illuminate eyes in one stroke, and to recreate her legendary eyeliner flick, fans can use her gel liner in dark emerald green. Boho babe: Speaking about the inspiration behind her boho themed beauty line, she said: 'I've always loved the laid-back bohemian look because it's all about individual creativity and self-expression' Kate has added her own range to the Salon Pro nail polish collection and explains that she has created five Bohemian shades, which will no doubt perfectly complement her new Topshop range. As for lips, Kate's previous collections have been some of the brand's best-selling and she has capitalised on this by expanding it. 'I've always loved the laid-back bohemian look because it's all about individual creativity and self-expression,' she said. 'I've worked with Rimmel to create a palette that combines rich, earthy tones with cool brights and soft nudes. Polished: Kate has added her own range to the Salon Pro nail polish collection offering five bohemian shades . Getting lippy: As for lips, Kate's previous collections have been some of the brand's best-selling and she has expanded to include more seasonal shades . 'Using the shades in my Urban Bohemian Collection for lips and nails, you can create a look as strong or as romantic as you like.' Kate's new Rimmel collection, which lands on May 14, comes just days after she unveiled her new range for Topshop. The . model's SS14 collection is full of seventies-style pieces . including fringed suede jackets, jump suits and maxi dresses. There's also embroidered smock-tops, silk blouses and graphic print kaftans that will go on sale in High Street stores globally and online. Eye candy: Kate has created a new range of eye liners, colourful mascaras and gels to create the perfect feline flick . Seventies chic: Kate models a fringed suede jacket, left, and a sparkly disco fringed dress from her new collection for Topshop . Vintage vibe: The collection includes maxi dresses for evening and day wear with many items inspired by Kate's own wardrobe . Kate is said to have taken . inspiration from her own wardrobe, which despite her status as a . supermodel, isn't just full of designer labels. She's also a fan of . scouring the rails of second hand stores. A weave waistcoat, suede . shorts and a deep blue fringed jacket are all in keeping with the . Seventies vibe. The latter is said to be inspired by a jacket the . 40-year-old has worn to three Rolling Stones concerts which she refers . to as her 'gig . jacket'. As well as . channelling a vintage look, she was also keen to reflect her laidback . style. There are baggy pyjama trousers glammed up through the use of satin . material in distinct prints and cool kaftans perfect for hitting the . beach in over the summer. Print kaftans and blouses are a wardrobe staple for jetsetter Kate, while a girl can't have enough LBDs . For evening wear, there are sexy frilled flapper style dresses and long numbers that flash a hint of thigh. Many of the dresses are also in keeping with the vintage-feel making use of fringing, sequins and crepe satin. Meanwhile there are also some tailored pieces for smart office wear including tuxedo style outfits and trouser suits as well as summery floral printed shirts. While much of the collection will be sold at affordable prices, one dress is a more pricey £600.

         "LIKE James Bond, Sir Roger Moore has at times enjoyed a martini. But the actor has revealed he can no longer drink the cocktail because of his Type 2 diabetes. Sir Roger, 86, was diagnosed with the condition last year, and it means he has to watch the amount of sugar and alcohol he consumes. A martini is a highly alcoholic cocktail, made from a combination of gin and vermouth. And it was Bond’s drink of choice when Sean Connery played the spy. Shaken not stirred: Sir Roger Moore, who starred in seven James Bond films, drinks a martini in 1968 . Opening up about his health condition, Sir Roger said: ‘I make a very good dry martini but I’m not allowed to drink them any more. No more sugar, no alcohol. I get to taste the wine and I can make a little sip last an hour. I enjoy it much more. I remember a lot more of what happened.’ Typically a martini is a gin-based drink, although it can also be made with vodka. In the 007 films Bond is known for ordering his martinis ‘shaken not stirred’, referring to the way in which they are made. The cocktail can also be made ‘with a twist’, which involves lemon peel, or ‘dirty’, where it contains olive brine. It was Connery’s Bond who drank martinis, Sir Roger explained, first uttering the ‘shaken not stirred’ catchphrase in Goldfinger. Sir Roger (pictured in 2013) was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes last year and can no longer drink martinis . In the past Sir Roger has admitted having a taste for champagne. These days, however, he sticks to soft drinks, claiming his ‘vice’ to be Diet Coke. And he has come up a guilt-free virgin cocktail – a Band Aid – which is a combination of non-alcoholic beer and Diet Coke. ‘No calories and it’s delicious,’ Sir Roger said. Giving an interview to the Sunday Telegraph the actor, who starred in seven James Bond films, went on to joke that he would indulge in martinis and ice cream if he knew he only had one day left to live. He said: ‘When I’m told I’ve got 24 hours to go, I’m going to have a couple of dry martinis with Tanqueray gin - not vodka - and a couple of choc ices with plain chocolate on the outside and white, white vanilla on the inside - oh, and baked beans.’ Sir Roger, who last appeared as 007 almost 30 years ago, revealed he had been diagnosed with diabetes last year. He had collapsed at home in Monaco and been rushed into hospital by his fourth wife Kristina Tholstrup. Doctors confirmed that the star, who had been losing weight for some time, was suffering from the condition. Appearing on US TV’s Late Show with David Letterman ‘I went to the doctor, and he said, “You know those high blood-sugar numbers you’ve been dealing with since you were 36? Well, you’ve graduated! You’ve got Type 2 diabetes, young man”.’ In the past Sir Roger has survived prostate cancer and had a pacemaker inserted.",

         "LONDON, England -- Scientists in the U.S. are developing a laser gun that could kill millions of mosquitoes in minutes. The WHO has reported that around half of the world's population is at risk of malaria. The laser, which has been dubbed a \"weapon of mosquito destruction\" fires at mosquitoes once it detects the audio frequency created by the beating of its wings. The laser beam then destroys the mosquito, burning it on the spot. Developed by some of the astrophysicists involved in what was known as the \"Star Wars\" anti-missile programs during the Cold War, the project is meant to prevent the spread of malaria. Lead scientist on the project, Dr. Jordin Kare, told CNN that the laser would be able to sweep an area and \"toast millions of mosquitoes in a few minutes.\" Malaria is a life-threatening disease caused by parasites that are transmitted to people from the bites of female mosquitoes. It is particularly prevalent in tropical and sub-tropical regions of the world and kills an African child every 30 seconds, according to the World Health Organization. There are an estimated 300 million acute cases of malaria each year globally, resulting in more than one million deaths, the WHO reports. Responding to questions about any potential harm the laser could pose to the eco-system, Kare said: \"There is no such thing as a good mosquito, there's nothing that feeds exclusively on them. No one would miss mosquitoes,\" he said. \"In any case,\" he added. \"The laser is able to distinguish between mosquitoes that go after people and those that aren't dangerous. What remains to be seen is how precise we can get.\" He added that other insects would not be affected by the laser's beam. Kare said the lasers could be mounted on lamp post-type poles and put around the circumference of villages, to create a kind of \"fence\" against mosquitoes. The research was commissioned by Intellectual Ventures, a Washington, U.S.-based company that was founded by Nathan Myhrvold, a former Microsoft Corporation executive. His previous boss, Bill Gates, who funded the research, asked Myhrvold to look into new ways of combating malaria.",

         "New York Yankees pitcher Michael Pineda has been suspended for 10 games after being caught using pine tar to help him grip the ball. The commissioner's office announced the penalty. The ban was to start for Thursday night's game in Boston unless Pineda appealed. There was no immediate word on whether Pineda would challenge the suspension. Suspicious substance: Michael Pineda was ejected from the game after umpires found a foreign substance on his neck . Pineda was . ejected in the second inning of Wednesday night's 5-1 loss at Fenway . Park after umpires found the pine tar on his neck. After the game, Pineda admitted he had used the pine tar to help him hold the ball on a cool, windy night. 'I'll learn from this mistake,' he said. 'It won't happen again.' Pine . tar is a sticky substance that baseball players will often put on the . handles of their bats to improve grip. Pitchers will use it for the same . reason, particularly in cold weather. However, MLB rules say that a . pitcher can't put any foreign substance on the ball because it can . potentially make the ball move more when a pitcher throws a curve ball. So pitchers will often try and hide it. If they get caught, they are . typically thrown out of the game - and that's exactly what happened to . Pineda. Scroll down for video . Busted: The substance was clearly visible on the pitcher's neck . The . right-hander was thrown out in the second inning when plate umpire . Gerry Davis found the substance on the right side of Pineda's neck after . Red Sox manager John Farrell asked him to check. Pineda walked from the . mound without protest. Both Pineda and Davis said it was pine tar. 'When . it's that obvious, something has got to be said,' Farrell explained . after the game. 'Our awareness was heightened, given what we had seen in . the past.' The ejection also set off a debate in the baseball world about pitchers who use pine tar, and whether it should be allowed in certain circumstances. Many former aces said they had done it, albeit in a more discreet manner. Rule 8.02(b) prohibits pitchers from altering the ball to gain an unfair advantage, and forbids them from having a foreign substance on them or in their possession on the mound. Pineda wasn't seen with the pine tar in the first inning, when the Red Sox roughed him up. Boston manager John Farrell asked plate umpire Gerry Davis to check Pineda after two fast outs the next inning. Got ya: Umpire Gerry Davis determined that the substance on Pineda's neck was pine tar, which is against the rules for pitchers . Earlier . this month, Pineda pitched well against the Red Sox at Yankee Stadium. Television cameras showed a substance on his hand during that outing â€” Pineda said it was dirt, not pine tar. Among . other suspensions of pitchers for pine tar in the past decade, Tampa . Bay's Joel Peralta was penalized eight games in 2012, the Angels' Brendan Donnelly 10 days in 2005 and St. Louis' Julian Tavarez 10 days . in 2004. The suspensions of Donnelly and Tavarez were cut to eight days . after they asked the players' association to appeal, and Peralta dropped . his challenge with no reduction. Yankees general manager Brian Cashman said Pineda and the organization were 'embarrassed.' Yankees manager Joe Girardi called it 'an error in judgment' and a 'little bump' and 'poor judgment.' 'He had a hard time gripping the baseball. Unknown to us, he put it on and went out there,' Girardi said. 'It's a young kid. I don't think he's trying to do anything, cheat. I think he's just trying to go out there and compete.' Obvious: Boston manager John Farrell said that when it's as obvious as it was on Pineda, he has to alert the umpires . In Pineda's previous start against the Red Sox, a 4-1 Yankees win in New York on April 10, television cameras caught Pineda with what appeared to be sticky pine tar on his hand on a cool night. Farrell didn't see a photograph of Pineda's hand until the fourth inning; when Pineda came out to warm up for the fifth, his hand was clean. Pineda said the dark substance was dirt but it sparked debate about pitchers' use of sticky substances to get a better grip on cool nights. On Wednesday, with the game time temperature at 50 degrees, Sizemore started the first with a triple and scored on Dustin Pedroia's single. With one out, Mike Napoli singled Pedroia to third. After Mike Carp flied to left, A.J. Pierzynski singled up the middle, scoring Pedroia. After Pineda's ejection, David Phelps came in and completed the strikeout of Sizemore. Trend: A similar brown, sticky substance was seen on Pineda's hand in another game against Boston on April 10 . John Lackey (3-2) allowed one run and seven hits in eight innings with 11 strikeouts and no walks. Koji Uehara struck out three in the ninth in a non-save situation. The previous time Lackey faced the Yankees he allowed four homers in a 7-2 loss on April 12. On Wednesday, he struck out the side in the third then had two strikeouts in each of the next two innings. Mike Napoli had three hits and Boston scored two runs in the first and two more in the third. The Yankees scored on Alfonso Soriano's sacrifice fly in the sixth.",

         "(CNN) -- Four suspects are sought in connection with the shooting death over the weekend of a Houston, Texas, doctor, Austin County authorities said Monday. Dr. Jorge Mario Gonzales was found shot to death at his ranch in rural Texas on Saturday, police say. Dr. Jorge Mario Gonzalez, 56, was chief of the critical care section at Houston's Methodist Hospital and \"a pulmonary medicine leader,\" according to the hospital system's Web site. He was found dead Saturday when deputies responded to a 911 call of a burglary in progress shortly after noon, said Austin County Sheriff's Office spokesman Sgt. Paul Faircloth. The responding officer was met by vehicles leaving the location, Faircloth said, and a person in one vehicle fired on the officer. The officer and his car were not struck, and the officer did not return fire, Faircloth said. The officer was able to provide a detailed description of the vehicles, he said. At the home, which Faircloth said is in a rural, wooded and isolated area, officers found Gonzalez shot to death and another person wounded. The second victim was airlifted to an Austin, Texas, hospital. Watch Dr. Gonzalez's son talk about his father » . Gonzalez's wife and small child were found unharmed inside the home, Faircloth said. CNN affiliate KHOU identified the woman as Charleen Gonzalez, 29, and the couple's 2-year-old son, and reported the two hid in a closet. Authorities do not know whether the incident was a burglary or an intended home invasion, Faircloth said, and \"we do not know if this is random or targeted.\" Several leads were being followed Monday morning, he said, and numerous agencies were involved in the investigation. The motive for the killing had not been determined on Monday. The slaying took place at Gonzalez's ranch outside Bellville, Texas, said Lisa Block, spokeswoman for the Texas Department of Public Safety. Gonzalez, his wife and child arrived at the ranch about 11 a.m. Saturday, she said, and \"the suspects were at the house when they arrived.\" Gonzalez's wife ran inside with the child and called 911, she said. Ranch worker Noel Galvan was the second victim, Block said. He was listed in critical condition, she said. Faircloth said earlier Monday five suspects were being sought, but later said police were seeking four. The vehicles seen leaving the home were a late '90s white Ford F-150 pickup, occupied by two Hispanic males, Faircloth said, and a red Honda or Acura with dark tinted windows sitting low to the ground, with one Hispanic male inside. The shots were fired from the white pickup, he said. Another vehicle mentioned earlier Monday was a two-toned silver and black Ford F-150 that had two Hispanic males inside. Faircloth said Monday afternoon that vehicle had been located and was not thought to be involved. However, police released a video of a gray Lexus on Monday, and would like to question its owners, Faircloth said. The drivers are believed to be an older couple. The car was seen before the officer encountered the white and red vehicles. \"The manhunt continues on the ground,\" Faircloth said. The suspects are considered armed and dangerous, he said. Faircloth said he had no information on whether the home had surveillance equipment. Family members told KHOU that Gonzalez went to the ranch nearly every weekend. \"It's deeply saddening for all of us,\" an older son of Gonzalez, Juan Mauricio Gonzalez, told KHOU. \"We are a tight-knit family and he was just a perfect man, a perfect father and a great physician.\" The Methodist Hospital System said Gonzalez will be missed, \"both as a friend and an outstanding clinician and researcher. Our prayers and thoughts go out to his family during this tragedy.\" \"This man had nothing to do with anybody,\" Juan Gonzalez told KHOU. \"He was a peaceful man. He was a wise man. He was just here to make people better and nothing else.\" A reward totaling $26,000 was offered for information in the case leading to an arrest. CNN's Melanie Whitley contributed to this report.",

Sir Bob Russell MP offered a two-hour tour around his constituency town of Colchester - but it had no bids on eBay . A walking tour of Britain’s oldest recorded Roman town hosted by an MP has failed to attract any bids in an eBay auction. The two-hour tour of Colchester, Essex, was to be led by Lib Dem Sir Bob Russell around the ‘significant places’ of his life. Part of the East of England Lib Dems’ fundraising efforts, the tour was listed on eBay with a starting price of £40 – but Sir Bob was left red-faced after it failed to attract any bids despite being on offer for a week. The ‘Rome around Colchester’, for one or two people, included high tea in the Castle Park Cafe. The MP, who leads a free walk every New Year's Day, was tight-lipped about where he would escort the winning bidder as part of the tour. The former councillor and Mayor of Colchester, elected to Parliament in 1997, said: 'We do not . get money from big business or trades union to fund our elections - . money is raised by members and supporters.' The sale was one lot in a supposed 'Amazing Autumn Auction' by the East of England Liberal Democrats to raise funds for their European election campaign. But only one item sold as part of the event: a guided tour of St Alban's Abbey by Sandy Walkington, the party's prospective parliamentary candidate for St Albans. The anonymous buyer paid £20 for the experience and described it as 'very good'. Colchester, then called Camulodunum, was a key stronghold in the empire of Ancient Rome. In AD41 it was the subject of a fierce battle to control Britain by the Roman emperor Claudius. In 2005 archeologists unearthed the remains of a walled structure more than 1,000ft long which was believed to be a Roman circus or chariot racing arena. One of several Roman finds in the city, it was the only verified example of a Roman circus in Britain. Colchester Castle, Essex, one of the many historic sites which would have delighted visitors on Sir Bob's tour .",

         "Amir Khan has hit back at insults from America’s flamboyant world champion Floyd Mayweather by claiming he is more famous than the welterweight known as the best pound-for-pound fighter on the planet. And in a neat dig at Mayweather’s famed macho ego, Khan insisted he throws more punches in one round than the unbeaten world champion manages in an entire fight. Mayweather, who has earned £300million in a unbeaten 47-fight career, is looking for a super-fight with Manny Pacquiao and dismissed Khan’s plea to fight him by claiming the Bolton fighter’s ‘name doesn’t carry enough weight’. Amir Khan has announced that he will donate the £30,000 shorts he wore during his last week to charity . Khan posted two pictures of his refurbished gym and clothes from his fight with Devon Alexander on Thursday . But Khan, back in his native North West after beating Devon Alexander in Las Vegas at the weekend, was in fighting form as he held court at The Gloves Community Centre boxing gym in his hometown. ‘Mayweather says I’m not a big enough name but I am a bigger name than his opponents Maidana, Guerrero and Victor Ortiz put together. ‘I am known in places like India, Pakistan, Dubai and the UAE where they don’t even know who Mayweather is. India has a billion people, Pakistan has 180m people and I can’t even walk down the street there. I am bigger than Mayweather in a lot of places and I can help him become more famous, and earn more money.’ Khan isn’t worried that 36-year-old Mayweather could catch him out. Khan was all smiles as he talked to the assembled press at his gym in Bolton . Khan is hoping his next fight will be against Floyd Mayweather next year . ‘Mayweather throws maybe three hundred punches in a fight, I could manage that in a single round,’ he said. ‘Floyd will never hurt me. I have been knocked down in other fights but Mayweather is not the biggest puncher, not as big as Alexander. Our fight would be like a game of chess, hit-move. It would be about footwork and accuracy, nothing more, nothing less. ‘I speak to legends like Roy Jones and Thomas Hearns and they say I would beat him. Even the taxi driver I spoke to in Vegas said he hoped I would knock him out. The people there want to see him humbled . ‘But Floyd is the boss. If he doesn’t want to fight me, he won’t. He’s not the type of guy where I could just turn up to his house and have a chat about it. But maybe all this stuff about me not being a big name is a sign he might be interested, he is starting to promote the fight. I don’t think him and Pacquiao will happen.’ Khan’s homecoming to England after wowing the Vegas fans has been bittersweet. His friend Anthony Crolla, who trains in the same gym, suffered a fractured skull and broken ankle after being hit on the head by a concrete slab as he confronted burglars. Khan lands a left hand during his impressive win on decision against Alexander . Khan arrived back in Manchester along with his wife and daughter on Wednesday . Mayweather says Khan's 'name holds no weight' and that he will not fight him . And the terrorist attack that killed 132 schoolchildren in Pakistan, where Khan’s family originate from, has also affected him badly. The £30,000 pair of shorts he wore at the weekend, containing a gold waistband, will be auctioned off to raise funds for the survivors. Talking about Crolla, Khan revealed that he had volunteered to be his pal’s sparring partner ahead of his world lightweight title shot against Richar Abril in Manchester on January 23, which has now been cancelled . ‘Me and Crolla are good friends,’ said Khan. ‘I roomed with him as an amateur. ‘His trainer Joe Gallagher was at my fight in Vegas and I told him I would spar with Crollar to help him because Abril is a long fighter, and I have got long arms, I can replicate his style. It is probable that Mayweather will insist on fighting Pacquiao, an eight-division champion, in his adopted hometown of Las Vegas . FLOYD MAYWEATHER . Age 37 . Born Michigan, USA .

I feel really bad, they have taken away his dream of fighting for a world title and tried to ruin his life, over nothing.’ Khan admits there must be doubts over whether Crolla can fight again. ‘When you have suffered something that bad, you have to understand the Board might not give him a license. It is very dangerous, is it worth that risk? ‘We fighters, even me in his position, would want to fight again, but sometimes you have to think of your health first.’ The attack on Crolla follows a knife attack on another potential Khan opponent, Kell Brook, in Tenerife earlier this year. The two incidents were totally unconnected but Khan says he is always conscious of trying to stay away from trouble outside boxing. ‘I don’t like fighting, I only do it when I am in the ring,’ he said.",

         "Clearly Jesus was sexy. After all, He is the Son of God. I don't mean to be disrespectful, but as I watched the trailer for the new movie, \"Son of God,\" I found myself gawking at the actor portraying Jesus. Diogo Morgado is one hot dude. His Jesus looks more like Brad Pitt than that nice man with the beard in all those paintings. I'm not the only one gawking at Morgodo's Jesus. He inspired the hashtag, \"#HotJesus\". It went viral on Twitter. The actor told The New York Times he doesn't want his looks to distract from the movie, but, \"If the message of Jesus was love, hope and compassion, and I can bring that to more people by being a more appealing Jesus, I am happy with that.\" Clearly we have a new trend. A \"more appealing\" Jesus is not just a better prophet, he's ... sexy. We actually don't know what Jesus looked like. We do know he was a carpenter, so perhaps Jesus was buff. But, I don't think when the Biblical Nathaniel asked, \"Nazareth! Can anything good come from there?\" and Phillip answered, \"Come and see,\" they were talking about Jesus' beautiful face or chiseled abs. Yes, Jesus, as portrayed in countless paintings, has a six-pack. As comedian and author, Greg Behrendt joked, \"I'd like to get ripped ... ripped like Jesus. Jesus was ripped. You've seen the pictures, right? He's ripped! Ripped. He's the son of God. He's not going to be walking around saying I've got back fat today, I'm so puffy.\" All joking aside, why must Jesus be sexy? Or ripped? Or even handsome? The Rev. Robert B. Lawton, SJ, a Jesuit priest and former president of Loyola Marymount University, says, \"There is absolutely no indication that Jesus was good-looking and sexy. In fact there is a passage in the prophet Isaiah that is taken as referring to Jesus. It says this: . \"He had no form or majesty that we should look at him/nothing in his appearance that we should desire him. He was despised and rejected by others; a man of suffering and acquainted with infirmity; and as one from whom others hide their faces he was despised, and we held him of no account.\" (Isaiah 53. 2-3.) While this might not be conclusive evidence, it's quite possible that Jesus was no Jewish Brad Pitt from Palestine. On the other hand, why wouldn't God create a perfect Son? \"Anything that is sexy is going to attract people. People who might not go to the movie might want to check it out, particularly non-Christians,\" says the Rev. Lisa Jenkins, senior pastor of St. Matthew's Baptist Church in Harlem. \"I don't see a problem with Jesus being attractive given our cultural context,\" she says. \"I don't recall a Jesus who was not appealing to the eye. That's Hollywood.\" Jenkins is more concerned about what she considers an inaccurate portrayal of Jesus' ethnicity. The Rev. James Martin, SJ, editor-at-large for America Magazine, and author of the coming book, \"Jesus: A Pilgrimage,\" agrees. \"God did not choose to incarnate himself in Laguna Beach,\" he says. \"He chose to incarnate Himself at a certain place, at a certain time in a certain person.\" And that person was a Palestinian Jew. \"Many people have a hard time with the humanity of Jesus ... the closer He is to human physical perfection, the easier it is for some to accept Him.\" But, Martin says, there is a danger in that too. A physically perfect Jesus makes Him into a God pretending to be man. When Jesus was both human and divine. \"He was like us in all things, except sin, as the theology goes,\" Martin says. \"That means, He had a body, He got sick, He got tired, He may have sprained an ankle or two. There are passages in the Gospel showing Him falling asleep because He was tired. We tend to airbrush the physical imperfections away.\" Those traits make Jesus so much more accessible. So much more ... human. I tried to come up with a living person to compare to Jesus. That, of course, is impossible. The closest I can come, as a Catholic, is Pope Francis. I've grown to revere him. Is it because he's sexy? In a word: No.",

         "By . Rachel Quigley . Last updated at 6:52 PM on 10th July 2011 . Theirs is more than just your average boy-meets-girl story. It's a New York love story, with a very modern twist. Allen Sheinman, 58, and his wife Collette Stallone, 56, said they know the secret to a happy and successful marriage - live in separate homes. For the first four years of wedded bliss the quirky couple - who met online - lived apart, she in Greenwich Village and he in West 23rd street in Manhattan. Secret: Collette Stallone said she believes marriage is a state of mind and doesn't see why two people have to live together . Force: Allen Sheinman said he didn't want to both get married and lived together but the recession drove them to cohabit . Allen - a managing editor at a trade publication - said: 'We consider seventh avenue a long hallway between our two domiciles.' But hard times hit as it did with many New Yorkers and when Allen's boss raised his rent to $1,800 a month, the couple did the unthinkable - they moved in together. Allen said: 'It was really a financial move to cohabit. Now we are transitioning into real-time marriage. This is it.' Speaking about living together - or not living together - Allen said it was an arrangement they were both comfortable with. He said: 'I told her I could handle getting married and living together, just not both. And to my relief she said, \"OK let's get married and keep our own places\". That's what I was hoping for.' Colette said: 'When you're young you think, \"Oh, . we’re in love,\" all that. But when you get older, you say, \"You know, I . love you, but I need my space\".' Expensive: Allen leaves his spacious apartment on West 23rd street because the rent was increased to $1,800 . Tight squeeze: There is barely room for Collette's stuff in her Greenwich Village apartment nevermind her husbands . When Allen moved into Colette's tiny one-bedroom Greenwich Village apartment, where she has been for 31 years, even then they weren't prepared to fully live together. Instead of embracing cohabitation, the couple drew up battle lines, put up invisible walls and lay down a set of ground rules. According to the New York Post, there was no crossing into each other's space without permission, she had her own bedroom - where she generously said he could sleep at weekends - and he slept in a sofa bed in the living room. The end?: The couple are still blissfully in love after four years of marriage and living apart but will cohabiting change that? They have their own newspaper and magazine subscriptions,' watch their own TV shows from their own space and even have a shower rota. The kitchen - which also hosts the apartment's only shower - is the only place that is allowed for both couples any time of the day or night. Colette - a retired high-school teacher who now runs her home-made jewellery business - believes that not living together was the secret to their happy marriage. 'Getting married is a state of mind, I don't see why we have to live together. I don't need to see him brush his teeth,' she told the Post. 'It's bad enough I see him brush his hair. 'I don’t know where this idea came from that you always have to be in the middle of whatever the other person is doing.' Alarmingly, she said when she told her ex-husband they were now living together he said: 'I give it four months.' The couple are featured in a documentary titled 'Two's a crowd' which will have its New York premiere at the Rooftop Films Summer Series on July 21.",

         "By . Associated Press . and Reuters . Honey mixed with sugar might be sweet, but it is not 'honey.' The Food and Drug Administration is taking steps to ensure that shoppers who buy honey are getting the real deal. New guidance issued Tuesday would prevent food companies from adding sugar or other sweeteners to pure honey and still calling it 'honey.' Funny honey: The Food and Drug Administration is taking steps to ensure that shoppers who buy honey are getting the real deal . The agency said enforcement action is possible against U.S. food businesses or importers if companies try to cut those sweeteners into real honey and do not label the product correctly. If those sweeteners are added, the label should read 'blend of sugar and honey' or 'blend of honey and corn syrup.' The FDA regularly detains honey imports and tests them after finding drug residues and unlabeled added sweeteners. Only manufactures that do not add sugar, corn syrup or other sweeteners should label their products as pure 'honey,' the FDA said in draft guidelines posted online. The proposal aims 'to advise the regulated food industry on the proper labeling of honey and honey products to help ensure that honey and honey products are not adulterated or misbranded,' the agency wrote. Americans consume more than 400 million pounds of honey each year, according to U.S. government and industry estimates. New rules: The guidance, released Tuesday, would stop food companies from putting sugar or other sweeteners into pure honey and still referring to it as honey . But just 149 million pounds were produced in the United States last year, U.S. Department of Agriculture data showed. To feed America's sweet tooth, much honey is imported, and U.S. producers are worried about cheap substitutes. Pure honey is generally more expensive than those mixed with corn syrup and traditional sugar, and prices reached a record high of $2.12 a pound last year, according to the USDA. The FDA's review follows a petition from the American Beekeeping Federation and several other related groups seeking a standard U.S. definition for the natural sweetener to promote fair trade.While the agency rejected their request, it said it was willing to look at labeling. Sticky situation: If sweeteners are added, the label should read 'blend of sugar and honey' or 'blend of honey and corn syrup' The FDA inspected imported honey to see whether it had been 'adulterated' with corn or cane sugars. In recent decades, it detained honey containing such substitutes from countries such as Brazil and Mexico, according to the agency. Manufacturers have 60 days to comment on the proposal before final guidelines are issued. Even then, however, guidelines are not mandatory.",

         "By . Lizzie Edmonds . William Henry Welch, 53, escaped punishment for driving without licence because his wife incorrectly told him he would be covered if he borrowed a friend's car . A star of My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding escaped punishment for driving without insurance after his wife checked his documentation as he can 'barely read', a court heard. William Henry Welch, 53, avoided six penalty points on his driving licence because his wife incorrectly told him he would be covered if he borrowed a friend's car, a court was told. Welch told Magistrates he asked his wife to look at his documents as he struggles with reading. He was granted an absolute discharge after admitting driving without insurance at Newton Aycliffe Magistrates' Court. Welch is a well-known campaigner for traveller and gipsy rights - and has appeared on My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding among other reality shows. Speaking after the case Welch said: 'It isn’t all doom and gloom when you go to these courts, if you go and you have a reasonable argument the magistrates are willing to listen. 'You should never just give up and think that they won’t listen to you because they will.' The court heard how Welch’s own car had broken down when he was working in Leominster, Herefordshire, and a friend loaned him a Vauxhall Vectra to drive back home. Welch told the court he had rung his wife, Rachel, to check he was covered to drive the Vectra. After reading the insurance policy she told him that he was. Welch of Darlington, Durham, told the court he left insurance documents to his wife because: 'I can barely read.' Mrs Welch, 49, told the court: 'We were both named on the insurance document and so I thought we were both policy holders.' Andrea Milson, prosecuting, told the court that as policyholder, Mrs Welch was covered to drive any car. However, as Mr Welch was a named driver he was only covered to drive the family car and not the borrowed Vectra. Welch, a well-known Gypsy campaigner, told the court he asked his wife to look at his documentation as he can 'barely read'. He has starred in numerous television shows including My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding . The car was stopped by police on the A456 in Worcestershire last August and Welch was subsequently charged with driving with no insurance and no MoT. Welch admitted both charges but, in a rare ‘special reasons hearing’, his solicitor, David Dedman, argued that the licence should not be endorsed with the usual six penalty points. 'This was an honest mistake,' said Mr Dedman. 'He genuinely believed he was insured and was misled by his wife, not deliberately or intentionally.' Magistrates granted Welch an absolute discharge on the matter of no insurance. They imposed no penalty points, but he was ordered to pay costs of £85. He was fined a further £100 for the offence of driving a vehicle with no MoT test certificate. Paddy Doherty walked free from court after headbutting his stepbrother in March . In March, Paddy Doherty, 55, walked free from court after admitting he headbutted his stepbrother. The 55-year-old breached the terms of a suspended jail sentence when he committed the assault at a pub in Flintshire, north Wales, in October 2013. He was given a six-month supervision order instead of jail time. The 2011 winner of Celebrity Big Brother had previously been handed a 31-week jail term, suspended for two years, in January 2012, after he brawled in the street with a fellow traveller. The show's infamous dressmaker Thelma Madine was sued by her head designer for unfair dismissal at the end of 2013.

         "Google is expanding its presence in Los Angeles with the $120 million purchase of a dozen acres of vacant land in the Playa Vista area on the city's west side. The parcel is zoned for nearly 900,000 square feet of commercial space that could house offices or studios, the Los Angeles Times reports. The plot is next to a historic hangar where aviator Howard Hughes built his famous 'Spruce Goose' airplane. Google also was expected to lease the hangar, which recently housed soundstages for movie and television, according to the newspaper. Acres: Google is expanding its presence in Los Angeles with the $120 million purchase of a dozen acres of vacant land in the Playa Vista area on the city's west side . Google: The parcel Google purchased is zoned for nearly 900,000 square feet of commercial space that could house offices or studios holding as many as 6,000 workers . City Councilman Mike Bonin, who represents the area, said the purchase 'brands Playa Vista as the tech and innovation capital of Los Angeles.' The Mountain View-based tech giant wouldn't detail its plans for the properties. Last year Microsoft opened a 20,000-square-foot space in Playa Vista, a neighborhood near major freeways, several neighborhoods and Los Angeles International Airport. Facebook has operations nearby, as do other major media companies and ad agencies. Three years ago, Google opened a campus in Venice, where it leased 100,000 square feet in three buildings for about 600 employees. One of those buildings is the famous Binoculars Building, a three-story office on Main Street designed by architect Frank Gehry. 'Spruce Goose':The plot is next to a historic hangar where aviator Howard Hughes built his famous 'Spruce Goose' airplane . A Google spokeswoman said the company, which typically likes to expand near its existing properties, will continue to rent the 69,000-square-foot Binoculars Building. Google views the Playa Vista land purchase as a long-term investment and has no particular design in mind for the site, she told the Times. Google also rents a 41,000-square-foot video production facility for subsidiary YouTube in a renovated former Hughes building in Playa Vista. Google already has bought or rented about 6.2 million square feet of space this year in the San Francisco Bay Area, bringing its total there to 15 million square feet, according to real estate brokerage statistics cited by the Times.",

         "(CNN) -- Investigators Wednesday exhumed the body of a 7-year-old Illinois girl slain more than five decades ago in hopes that modern science will bolster the case against the man now accused of killing her. The remains of Maria Ridulph, dead since 1957, were exhumed for tests as the 71-year-old suspect in her killing was headed back to Illinois from Seattle, DeKalb County State's Attorney Clay Campbell told reporters. \"Suffice to say science has advanced greatly, thankfully, since that time and we're hoping that advancement in science can assist us in our investigation of this case,\" Campbell said. Ridulph disappeared while playing with a friend near her home in Sycamore, Illinois, about 60 miles west of Chicago. Her body was found five months later and 120 miles away. Jack Daniel McCullough, the man now facing murder charges in her death, was an early suspect in the disappearance but had an alibi: He told police that he was at a military recruiting station in Rockford, Illinois, about 20 miles away, the evening Ridulph was reported missing. McCullough told investigators he had been given a train ticket from Rockford to Chicago by the military, then returned home and went on a date with his girlfriend. But when police interviewed the woman again in 2010 and asked if she had any photos of McCullough, she discovered an unused train ticket from Rockford to Chicago that she said he had given her on the date of the crime. The discovery led to McCullough's arrest in Seattle in early July. Campbell said Wednesday that McCullough was en route to Illinois from Washington state to face murder charges in Ridulph's death. Maria's brother, Charles Ridulph, appeared at a news conference with Campbell and said the family had agreed to the exhumation. \"Although the events were very difficult and very unsettling, we understand the necessity for these things, and we are in complete agreement and thankful for the way this case is being handled,\" he said.",

Rumours are circulating that Sony is preparing to launch its next generation games console soon after the Japanese tech giant sent out invitations to an event on 'the future of PlayStation.' Sony would not say whether it was preparing to unveil the successor to the 70million selling PS3 at the February 20 meeting in New York, but the prospect had gamers abuzz on Twitter. 'We will be talking about the PlayStation business,' Sony spokesman Masaki Tsukakoshi said today. Tantalising: A still from the video Sony released to drum up excitement over its PlayStation announcement . Despite that, the scale of the excitement over the meeting was indicated by a Google search for 'Sony Feb 20 PlayStation' which returned more than 7million hits. The last time Sony held a PlayStation event, in January 2011, it presented a protoype of its handheld Vita console. Before that, it convened a gathering in 2005 two months after it first demonstrated the PS3 concept. A meeting in 1999 revealed designs for the PS2. It has been more than six years since Sony launched the PS3 home console, a longer gap than between it and its PS2 predecessor, adding to the anticipation that it will soon disclose its next gaming concept. Current generation: Sony's super-slim . PlayStation 3 has been on the market for more than six years, selling some 70million units, making the . Japanese technology firm long overdue a new flagship product launch . Despite remaining tight-lipped about the specific purpose of the press conference, the company published a teaser video about the meeting on YouTube which has already been viewed more than 400,000 times in less than 24 hours. The video also promoted a Twitter hashtag, #Playstation2013, to which video game fans flocked to share their excitement about the forthcoming event.

Such a console would follow Nintendo's Wii U, which launched last autumn, and precede Microsoft's next Xbox game console, which will likely be unveiled in June at the E3 video game conference in Los Angeles. The PlayStation Vita: The portable console, successor to the PSP, was unveiled the last time Sony held a PlayStation event, in January 2011 . Since Sony's last home console launch, the games market has been transformed by the boom in smartphones and tablet computers that have wooed players with free or cheap games. Sony and its video game rivals Nintendo and Microsoft now have to contend with competition from powerful hand-held devices made by Apple, Samsung and a string of others. Analysts expect that tablets and other mobile devices will match the power and graphics of today's games consoles within a few years. Many are already able to run the kinds of 3D games that were once the exclusive preserve of those dedicated machines and high-spec gaming PCs. Struggling under competitive pressure, Nintendo on Wednesday cut its sales target for the Wii U, successor to its 100million-selling Wii, to 4million machines by the end of March from its launch in November. That compared with an earlier forecast for 5.5million.",

The Juventus star was forced to undergo knee surgery in May but returned in time to help Chile reach the last 16 of the World Cup - despite failing to complete a full 90 minutes in Brazil. The 27-year-old was strongly linked with a move to Manchester United in the summer, but the deal never materialised. Arturo Vidal has revealed he is still struggling with a knee injury he sustained last season . And the midfielder has admitted he is still not 100 per cent fit. 'The knee caused - and is causing - me problems,' Vidal told reporters after Juventus' 2-1 derby win over Torino in Serie A on Sunday. 'But I'm trying to get in top shape.'

Controversial wannabe-glamour model Josie Cunningham revealed she will be throwing a bash for her breasts two years after the £5,000 operation. And to show her gratitude for her enlarged assets, she took to Twitter to invite Hunt, MP for South West Surrey and Secretary of State for Health. Invitation: Josie Cunningham (right) invited Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt (left) to a bash for her boobies . She tweeted: '@JosieCOnline @Jeremy_Hunt having a birthday party for my boobies at the end of the month. To show how grateful I am..... Wanna come??? Xxx' Sadly, Hunt didn't reply. Minutes earlier she had announced she would be throwing the party in London in 'a couple of weeks'. Last month it was revealed Miss Cunningham would be the star of her own documentary on Channel 4 called 'The Most Hated Woman in Britain'. Her agent announced the news on Twitter, although Channel 4 said the programme had not yet been finalised. Engaged: Josie Cunningham (left and right) announced she was engaged to Andrew Goy (right in left photo) The 23-year-old shot to notoriety when she boasted about having a £4,800 breast enlargement on the NHS. TV star: Last month it was revealed Josie would be the star of her own documentary on Channel 4 called 'The Most Hated Woman in Britain' Anger over her shameless boasts grew when she claimed she considered aborting her child so she could appear on TV show Big Brother. In December, Miss Cunningham announced her engagement to Andrew Goy by sharing a photo of her pink heart-shaped engagement ring online. The engagement, which was then confirmed by a representative for Miss Cunningham, comes just weeks after the couple were first pictured in Leeds city centre. There have also been reports that Miss Cunningham is pregnant with Goy's child. Last month, Miss Cunningham also revealed she had wrongly told one man that he was the father of her baby daughter by sending him the wrong DNA result. She had asked three men to take a paternity test to determine who was Grace's father and wrote the outcome in cards to be delivered in time for Christmas Day. But the mother-of-three mixed up the notes and sent the positive result to the wrong man.

         "By . Katy Winter . PUBLISHED: . 08:09 EST, 20 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 08:48 EST, 20 December 2013 . A mother has shed more than half her body weight for the festive season after being disgusted by a photo taken at a Christmas party last year. Carol Bryant, 42, from Brighton, was 'horrified' by her 21 stone frame when she saw a photo of herself socialising with a friend. The full-time mother vowed to shed the weight in time for the following festive season - and this year she will be rewarded for her efforts as she can host her own Christmas party as a svelte size 12. 'I looked like a Christmas pudding': Carol Bryant, right, said she was was horrified when she saw this picture of herself at a Christmas party last year . Slim: Carol has now dropped from 21 stone to 9 stone 10lbs and a trim size 12 after going on an extreme diet . She said: 'I was mortified when the photo went up on Facebook. l didn't even recognise myself at first, I looked like a Christmas pudding.' Determined to change her ways, in January 2013 she decided to try a meal replacement programme which limits your daily calorie intake to just 500 calories each day. 'I knew I had to do something about my weight,' she explained. Ian Marber, nutritionist says: 'The diets are monitored and so are considered safe for that reason. 'But very low calorie diets are not to be undertaken in the long term without supervision and also, importantly, clearance from your GP. 'It's what you eat after the diet has finished that's vital and I recommend seeing a nutrition professional afterwards to learn how to eat, not how to diet.' 'I was absolutely massive and I was terrified I would have a heart attack. 'Not to mention how awful I looked in photographs next to my slim friends. 'I was so jealous of all the fashionable clothes they got to wear, while I was stuck in frumpy t-shirts and baggy trousers.' After sticking to the plan for a . year, Carol has shed 12 stone and gone from a size 28 to a trim . size 12 in time for Christmas. 'This year there will be no hiding at Christmas parties for me,' said proud Carol. 'I've already picked out a gorgeous, shimmering size-12 dress to show off my trim, new figure. And I feel incredible.' Devastated by seeing herself in the photos Carol vowed to boycott Christmas parties until she lost the weight . Unsurprisingly, Carol's 5000 calorie-a-day diet saw her weight balloon from 15 stone and a size 16, to a massive 21 stone and a size 28 . 'No role model': Carol quit her job working in an office to become a full-time mother to Lois, now six, pictured, but found herself spending a lot of time on the sofa . Carol had always struggled with her weight. When she was in her teens she was a size 16, then in 2007 after having her daughter Lois, now six, she piled on more pounds. This year she will be rewarded for her efforts and hosting her own Christmas party as a svelte size 12 . She quit her job working in an office to become a full-time mother, but would spend her days sat on the sofa gorging on greasy take-aways, fatty chocolates and salty crisps. Unsurprisingly, her 5000 calorie-a-day diet saw her weight balloon from 15 stone and a size 16, to a massive 21 stone and a size 28. Carol says: 'It was disgusting how large I got, and I was no role model for my little girl. I was constantly hungry and would shovel platefuls of food down my throat without even thinking. It was an addiction.' But within the first two weeks of her diet, Carol had lost an incredible 24Ibs. 'The weight was just falling off of me,' she said. 'It was an amazing feeling and it spurned me on to lose more weight.' Carol also began walking every day so she now she weighs in at just 9st 10Ibs, dress size 12. Instead of having the meal replacements, she's now joined Slimming World so she can sustain her weightloss and said she's never felt more confident. 'This year I can't wait to show off my party dress,' she said. 'I won't be hiding away in the corner, I want to be the centre of attention. I want to party my way through the celebrations, making up for all those lost years.' Breakfast: Four slices of white toast, buttered . Lunch: White bread cheese sandwich with crisps, soda . Dinner: Doner Kebab with chips . Snacks: White toast with butter, crisps, chocolate, block of cheese . Breakfast: Fruit smoothie . Lunch: Vegetable soup, brown bread . Dinner: Quorn chilli with brown rice and vegetables . Snacks: Fruit, plain yogurt .",

         "Sporting only the most stylish designer labels, wearing only meticulously matched colors, the Congo's dandies are the very embodiment of sartorial elegance. Known as \"Sapeurs,\" these dapper dressers are a Congolese subculture devoted to the cult of style. In Brazzaville and Kinshasa -- the capitals of neighboring Republic of the Congo and the Democratic Republic of the Congo -- they stand out among the widespread poverty, strutting the streets like walking works of art. \"It's the fetishization of fashion -- they are the worshippers of fashion, it's their god, it's powerful,\" says Didier Gondola, author of \"History of the Congo,\" who has extensively researched the Sapeurs. But for the Sapeurs -- who are almost always men -- it's not about what's in vogue, it's about style. The labels they covet most are those that evoke classic elegance. Suits by Yves Saint Laurent, Jean Paul Gaultier and Armani are all in demand, as are Japanese labels Kenzo and Yamamoto, says Gondola. When it comes to shoes, exclusive French label Weston and British label Church's reign supreme. And imitations will not be tolerated. \"You can lose your reputation if you are wearing imitation,\" says Gondola. \"That's something blasphemous.\" See also: Desert festival: Oasis for sounds of the Sahara . But these labels don't come cheap. Gondola, who was born in the Congo and teaches history at Indiana University in the United States, explains that Sapeurs aren't rich; they typically work menial jobs, and have been known to resort to shoplifting to feed their addiction to apparel. In Brazzaville, it's common for Sapeurs to rent or borrow clothes from fellow fops or requisition them from friends visiting from Europe. As the Congolese Diaspora has spread, so have the Sapeurs. They can now be found in European capitals including London, Brussels and Paris. Dixy Ndalla, 30, was born and raised in Brazzaville, but has lived in London since the age of 17. He's infatuated with the classic cuts worn by the British aristocracy and can spend £1,000 a month on new shirts and jackets. \"I am very passionate about clothing, I'm passionate about colors and suits,\" he says. \"In the winter it's anything to do with tweeds, in the summertime a nice blazer, a beautiful pair of jeans, a beautiful shirt. \"I especially love Hackett, one of the top designers in the UK ... Hackett suits start from around £600 and a bespoke made-to-measure will go out from £1,000 and upward.\" Ndalla travels back to Brazzaville in the summer and takes pride in showing off his very British attire. \"In the summer holidays, everyone goes to show their outfits,\" he says. \"They all meet in one street or bars and they all show their colors or the label of their suits ... it's up to people to judge and appreciate who's dressed well.\" Once dressed in their finery, Brazzaville's Sapeurs will often head to \"Le Main Bleu,\" a favorite bar, where they have informal contests. Each tries to out Sap each other with their combination of style, comportment and designer labels -- known as \"griffes.\" But Ndalla doesn't consider himself a Sapeur, because he doesn't dress up to compete with others. For him, it's simply about taking pride in what you wear. \"People from Congo love to dress up -- it's something that's in my blood,\" he says. Although every Sapeur has their own unique style, certain looks are especially popular. Pastel-colored three-piece suits are a staple of the Sapeurs' fastidiously assembled ensembles. They are finished off with a tie, cravat or bow tie -- and the obligatory pocket square protruding from their immaculately tailored jackets. Cigars and pipes -- lit or unlit -- are de rigueur. Italian photographer Daniele Tamagni stumbled across the Sapeurs when he travelled to Brazzaville in 2007. The next year he returned to photograph them, collecting his images in the book \"Gentlemen of Bacongo.\" He says individuals often belong to sub groups within the Sapeur culture, such as the Piccadilly group, who dress in Scottish kilts. \"One member has a sister in Scotland who brings him kilts,\" he explains. \"They use and they adapt to their taste and individuality. They are masters of style, they create their own style.\" See also: Congo's erupting volcano boosts tourism . Some disapprove of the Sapeurs spending what little money they have on the frivolities of fashion. But Gondola argues that being a Sapeur isn't just about vanity -- it's a political statement. In the 1970s \"authenticity\" was part of the state ideology in the DRC -- a policy that prohibited the wearing of Western suits. The Sapeurs rebelled by wearing aggressively non-conformist clothes, including leather suits, says Gondola. To this day Kinshasa's Sapeurs dress less conservatively than their suit-sporting Brazzaville brethren. \"The Sapeur is also about masculinity, politics, changing the stereotypes about how people view Africa,\" says Gondola. \"It's about a lot of things, about beating the West at its own game, which is fashion: 'You colonized us but we dress better than you.'\" Gondola says the history of the Sapeurs can be traced back to the 19th century, when the Republic of the Congo was a French colony. Some colonial masters would pay their servants in used clothes, and those servants would make a show of wearing their masters' clothes on Sundays. He adds that the phenomenon grew in the 1920s and 30s among Congolese nationals living in Paris -- in particular Sap pioneer and anti-colonial activist André Matswa. But it really took off after independence in 1960, when ordinary Congolese people would travel to Paris and return home wearing the latest fashions. In the 1970s, popular musician Papa Wemba, from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (formerly Zaire), began promoting the idea of the Sapeur, forming the \"Société des Ambianceurs et Persons Élégants,\" or SAPE, of which many modern-day Sapeurs claim membership. So what is the enduring appeal of the Sapeur? \"It's politics, spiritual, aesthetic, social -- so many things,\" says Gondola. \"It's a whole science -- they are artists.\"",

Brazzaville in the summer and takes pride in showing off his very British attire In the summer holidays everyone goes to show their outfits he says They all meet in one street or bars and they all show their colors or the label of their suits its up to people to judge and appreciate whos dressed well Once dressed in their finery Brazzavilles Sapeurs will often head to Le Main Bleu a favorite bar where they have informal contests Each tries to out Sap each other with their combination of style comportment and designer labels known as griffes But Ndalla doesnt consider himself a Sapeur because he doesnt dress up to compete with others For him its simply about taking pride in what you wear People from Congo love to dress up its something thats in my blood he says Although every Sapeur has their own unique style certain looks are especially popular Pastelcolored threepiece suits are a staple of the Sapeurs fastidiously assembled ensembles They are finished off with a tie cravat or bow tie and the obligatory pocket square protruding from their immaculately tailored jackets Cigars and pipes lit or unlit are de rigueur Italian photographer Daniele Tamagni stumbled across the Sapeurs when he travelled to Brazzaville in 2007 The next year he returned to photograph them collecting his images in the book Gentlemen of Bacongo He says individuals often belong to sub groups within the Sapeur culture such as the Piccadilly group who dress in Scottish kilts One member has a sister in Scotland who brings him kilts he explains They use and they adapt to their taste and individuality They are masters of style they create their own style See also Congos erupting volcano boosts tourism Some disapprove of the Sapeurs spending what little money they have on the frivolities of fashion But Gondola argues that being a Sapeur isnt just about vanity its a political statement In the 1970s authenticity was part of the state ideology in the DRC a policy that prohibited the wearing of Western suits The Sapeurs rebelled by wearing aggressively nonconformist clothes including leather suits says Gondola To this day Kinshasas Sapeurs dress less conservatively than their suitsporting Brazzaville brethren The Sapeur is also about masculinity politics changing the stereotypes about how people view Africa says Gondola Its about a lot of things about beating the West at its own game which is fashion You colonized us but we dress better than you Gondola says the history of the Sapeurs can be traced back to the 19th century when the Republic of the Congo was a French colony Some colonial masters would pay their servants in used clothes and those servants would make a show of wearing their masters clothes on Sundays He adds that the phenomenon grew in the 1920s and 30s among Congolese nationals living in Paris in particular Sap pioneer and anticolonial activist André Matswa But it really took off after independence in 1960 when ordinary Congolese people would travel to Paris and return home wearing the latest fashions In the 1970s popular musician Papa Wemba from the Democratic Republic of the Congo formerly Zaire began promoting the idea of the Sapeur forming the Société des Ambianceurs et Persons Élégants or SAPE of which many modernday Sapeurs claim membership So what is the enduring appeal of the Sapeur Its politics spiritual aesthetic social so many things says Gondola Its a whole science they are artists"

The spate of terrifying night-time rapes in an isolated, orthodox Christian community went on for four years and yet the victims could barely remember the ordeal and many believed they had dreamed it. It was not until 2009 that nine men were eventually convicted of the rape of more than 100 women and girls in their own homes in the Mennonite Manitoba Colony in Bolivia. But despite the convictions, it has emerged that the sexual attacks in the closed community are continuing. More than 100 women and girls were raped in the Mennonite Manitoba Colony in Bolivia but despite the convictions four years ago residents have admitted that the sexual assaults have continued (file picture) An investigation has uncovered that once more women and youngsters in the Old Colony, where motorised vehicles and electricity are banned, are suffering sexual assaults they can barely remember. Vice.com has found that many families believe the assaults are continuing despite the men, aged 19 to 43, being jailed. But members of the closed community told Vice . that without cameras or streetlights - both forbidden in the community - or a police force, they have no way to stop or catch the rapists. They say they will have to wait until someone is caught in the act and in the meantime increase security at their homes. One husband, whose wife was raped in the first spate of attacks, told Vice.com: 'It's definitely not as frequent.  are being much more careful than before, but it still goes on.' From 2005 to 2009, women complained that they regularly woke up to intense pain and semen and blood on their sheets but their claims were not initially investigated and they were not believed. Some even reported waking up to find rope tied to their wrists or ankles or dirty fingerprints on their bodies but the victims could not remember the previous night. Many women had hazy memories or images of at least one man on top of them but they were not able to resist. Residents say they have heard repeated rumours that the night-time rapes have continued but because the closed community does not have a police force the alleged crimes are unlikely to be investigated (file picture) The Manitoba Colony in eastern Bolivia is home to about 3,000 people . The eventual trial found that the attackers used a powerful sedative to drug whole families before carrying out the rapes. Many . women were attacked as they lay next to their husbands, who were also . knocked unconscious by the narcotic. A girl of just three was among the victims and a woman of 60 years old. A pregnant woman gave birth at just six and a half months after being raped while unconscious. Young girls were taken to hospital the next morning suffering from terrible pain and bleeding. The gang of men, who had led some women to believe they were repeatedly attacked by demons, were eventually caught and jailed in 2009. Two of the men were found trying to break into a house and their story unraveled. Each of the nine-strong gang were jailed for 25 years and a vet who supplied the anaesthetic - made from a cow tranquilizer - was sentenced to 12 years. The colony - about 94 miles from Santa Cruz and home to about 3,000 ultraconservative Mennonites - has been deeply scarred by the scandal. Sara Guenter told Vice that she tried to stay awake and asked a trusted worker to guard the house but the attacks continued when no one was watching her home. She said: 'It happened so many times, I lost count.' Some residents initially believed the rape claims were concocted to hide affairs while others believed it was down to 'wild female imagination.'

         "(CNN) -- Sina Weibo, China's most popular microblogging platform, has introduced a VIP paid membership package in an effort to monetize its vast community of 324 million users who use its services for free. The VIP membership includes fifteen \"special privileges\" under the categories of user personalization, functions, mobile phone, and security. These perks range from using fancier homepage templates, following a higher number of users, and receiving SMS birthday alerts and password reminders. Users can increasingly access these features, as they progress through six different levels of membership based on points awarded for usage. A one-month subscription is priced at 10 RMB (US$ 1.57). Discounts are offered for longer subscriptions of three months to two years. The VIP package has generally been met with muted enthusiasm by industry analysts. The free features of the site are sufficient for users, You Tianyu, an analyst at Beijing-based internet consultancy iResearch, told state newspaper, Global Times. He predicted the premium services would not be significantly profitable and recommended that Sina concentrate on advertising and gaming revenues. This move follows monetization initiatives introduced last year, such as \"Weibi\" virtual currency and \"Weihao\" custom account numbers. Sina Corporation, which also operates the popular Sina web portal, reported a net loss of US$ 13.7 million for the first quarter of 2012, despite a 6% year-on-year increase in net revenue to $106.2 million.",

         "(CNN) -- Premier League big-spenders Manchester City will renew their search for a new world-class striker after ending their interest in Barcelona striker Samuel Eto'o. Eto'o will not be playing for Manchester City next season after the English club ended their interest in him. The Cameroon international, who is about to embark on the last year of his contract at the Nou Camp, felt he should receive a significant portion of the £18million ($29m) fee City were willing to pay -- as he would be entitled to leave for nothing next summer. City manager Mark Hughes initially signalled his intention to wait for Eto'o to resolve the wrangle. Yet, as the week has dragged on, the argument has just got more confusing and complicated. Latest transfer rumors and gossip . It was suggested City were ready to offer Eto'o a deadline of this weekend to determine his future. However, in the end, City chairman Khaldoon al-Mubarak did not even give the 28-year-old that long, with Barcelona officially contacted on Friday with confirmation the deal was off. \"Samuel Eto'o is undoubtedly a fine footballer but the circumstances surrounding him were such that the deal could not be completed,\" City chief executive Garry Cook told the club's official Web site. \"We now feel the time is right to pursue other avenues. We have a clear strategic transfer plan, which we continue to follow.\" England midfielder Gareth Barry and Paraguayan striker Roque Santa Cruz have already joined the club this summer and Argentine forward Carlos Tevez is expected to complete his move from rivals Manchester United in the near future. Chelsea and England captain John Terry and Everton defender Joleon Lescott also remain high on the club's wish-list. Meanwhile, two players leaving the club are midfielder Gelson Fernandes and Brazilian striker Jo. Swiss international Fernandes has completed his move to French side St Etienne, while Jo has returned to Everton on loan for the season. In other transfer news, Sunderland have swooped to sign Manchester United's reserve team striker Fraizer Campbell for £3.5m ($5.67m) on a four-year contract.",

         "(CNN) -- A judge Friday upheld a Cleveland, Ohio, jury's recommendation that convicted serial killer Anthony Sowell be sentenced to death. Jurors convicted Sowell of 11 counts of aggravated murder and more than 70 other charges, including abusing corpses and kidnapping. Wednesday, they recommended the death penalty. The convictions ended a saga that began in October 2009 with the discovery of the first two victims' remains inside Sowell's home in Cleveland. He eventually was accused of killing at least 11 women ranging in age from 25 to 52. Cuyahoga County Judge Dick Ambrose imposed the sentence Friday morning. He could have overruled jurors and imposed a life sentence. Sowell, who pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity, had his eyes closed during almost all of Friday's hearing, CNN affiliates reported. He made no comment. Family members of the victims were allowed to make statements. \"Anthony, you will deal with a much higher power for the pain you have caused,\" said Donnita Carmichael, daughter of victim Tonia Carmichael. \"You are an animal and hell awaits your arrival.\" Sowell's lawyers had asked for life in prison. Parole would not have been an option because Sowell, 51, is classified as a \"sexually violent predator.\" During the penalty phase of his trial, Sowell said he was \"sorry.\" \"I know that may not sound like much. But I truly am sorry from the bottom of my heart,\" he said. During his trial, Sowell maintained a candid banter with members of his defense team as he recounted claims of childhood abuse -- both physical and sexual. He grew up in East Cleveland, joined the Marines at age 18 and traveled to California, North Carolina and Japan, authorities said. Sowell served 15 years in prison for attempted rape before being released in 2005. People who met him after his release described him as \"a normal guy.\" He was known locally for selling scrap metal. Sowell's inconspicuous two-story home sat in a dilapidated neighborhood known as Mount Pleasant. A stench hovered around the area, but no one realized it was the scent of decaying human flesh, instead assuming it was a byproduct of a nearby sausage factory. Many of Sowell's victims struggled with drug addiction at some point, and court records showed many resorted to stealing and prostitution to support their habits. The disappearances of the women -- many of whom lived near him -- went largely unnoticed for two years, with only four women being reported missing.",

And one of Michelle Rodriguez's closest confidants has revealed she is so in love with British supermodel Cara Delevingne that she believes she is 'the one' - and wants to start a family with her. In an exclusive interview with MailOnline, the friend of the Fast and Furious . star - who has asked to remain unnamed - reveals how Michelle, 35, is so besotted by Cara, 21, that she . has already told pals she would love a baby with her. But while the actress is planning her future with Cara - who is 14 years younger than her - we can reveal the Mulberry model’s family is terrified of the influence the wayward star is having on the top model who has become the toast of the fashion industry. Scroll down for videos . Inseparable: Before jetting to Italy Cara, 21, and 35-year-old Michelle were seen out on the town in London . The start of something: Model Cara Delevingne shared a kiss . with openly bisexual actress Michelle Rodriguez as they sat courtside at the . New York Knicks game at Madison Square Garden in January. Baring all: Michelle Rodriguez shared a photo on Instagram on Tuesday which showed her stark naked while meditating . The . source, who Michelle regularly confides in, said: 'Michelle comes from . a broken home and it has a lot to do with why she has found herself in . trouble again and again throughout her life. 'Constantly, . she pushes boundaries and has been in trouble with the law, but really . all of it is because she is desperate to be loved. 'Her mom and dad separated when she was a child and ever since Michelle has been yearning for some stability in her life. 'Sadly after years of dating older women and men like Olivier Martinez, nothing seemed to work out for her. 'But now Cara has come along, who is so much younger than the women she normally dates, but suddenly Michelle is happy again.' In . recent years, former Lost star Michelle, who openly admits she is bisexual, has endured a string of broken relationships after dating French heartthrob and S.W.A.T co-star Olivier Martinez, Fast and Furious co-star Vin Diesel as well as model Claudette Lali, director Francesca De Sola and . model Aleksandra Rastovic. The source claims Michelle had a 'great thing' going with Terminator 3 actress Kristanna Loken - who strongly hinted to Advocate magazine that she was in a relationship with her in 2006, yet Michelle has never confirmed their relationship. 'Kristanna wanted to come out as a couple. She's proud to be bisexual, but Michelle wasn't ready to go public,' said the friend: 'So instead of working it out, Michelle ended it. Smitten: Michelle was linked with Terminator 3 actress Kristanna Loken, who hinted the couple were in a relationship in 2006 . Ex-lovers: Michelle Rodriguez iis said to have dated flimmaker Francesca de Sola. The pair are pictured at the screening of Francesca's film 1%ers in New York in April 2013 . 'Then she was left heartbroken a year later when she fell for another model/actress only to find out she had slept with someone else while she was away filming the movie Avatar.' The actress has also found herself behind bars after being in trouble repeatedly with the . law. In March 2002, she was . charged with assault and harassment when her girlfriend, Louise Ward, . claimed the tough girl had attacked her in their New Jersey apartment. Ward was left battered and bruised, but later dropped all charges against Michelle. The friend said: 'Michelle can be intense and dive head first into . romances. This can land her in hot water as she found out with Louise. 'Over the last 15-years there have been countless other examples of her disastrous love life.' Just one year later Michelle found herself in trouble again when she . appeared in court to face eight misdemeanor charges relating to two . driving incidents, including a DUI and a hit and run. In . 2004, she pleaded no contest to three of the charges, hit and run, . drunken driving and driving with a suspended license and went to jail . for 48 hours and was placed on probation for three years. And in 2005, while filming ABC hit Lost in Hawaii, the stunning brunette was fined multiple times for speeding. Later . that year on December 1st she was arrested for drunk driving, to which . she pleaded guilty and paid a $500 fine and spent five days in jail. Due . to this being a clear violation of her earlier drunk driving crimes, . she was also sentenced to 60 days in jail, but due to overcrowding was . released on the same day she entered. And it's precisely this behavior that has left Cara's family a little fearful. Michelle's close friend admitted: 'She's a very free spirit and before this relationship she has always been terrified of commitment. “And because of her troubled past, many of them have essentially had to be her babysitter or a mother figure to her. 'So now Cara might be younger than her, but she honestly thinks this is 'the one'. Just before she met Cara she was talking about wanting a family within the next couple of years. Lovers? Michelle Rodriguez reportedly dated Vin Diesel, her Fast and Furious co-star. The pair pose at the premiere of Fast and Furious 6 in Seoul, South Korea, in May 2013 . Ex-love: Michelle Rodriguez was also said to have dated her S.W.A.T co-star Olivier Martinez. The actor is now married to Halle Berry . 'She . really wants a baby and wants one soon and now she has found Cara she . thinks this could finally be the time to chase that dream. 'Sadly due to Michelle’s troubled past, Cara’s family are not so sure.They are not 100 per cent pro this relationship and are in some ways willing it to end. 'The 14-year age gap between the girls concerns them as does Michelle's wayward reputation. 'They . know Cara has been swept off her feet by Michelle, who has dropped . everything to be with her young love, but the family fear the . relationship will end in nothing but disaster. 'I highly doubt at 21-years-old Cara is ready to start a family. She is no doubt currently smitten with Michelle, who dropped everything, including her girlfriend and friends, to be with her. 'But . if anyone is going to get their heart broken in this relationship it's . going to be Michelle. She will smother Cara, and wants to be around her . 24 hours a day.' The couple, who apparently met in . January, were also seen attending Prince's secret gig at Ronnie Scott's . club on Monday, February 17, and the Elle Style Awards the following . evening before heading to Milan to . close the autumn/winter fashion season. They then hired a private jet last week to head to Milan Fashion Week, where Cara had a busy schedule. The pair were spotted in coordinating black outfits while carrying bags as they made their way to their airplane - while the Brit beauty's parents were also along for the trip. After landing in Milan, Michelle sat with her love as she sat in hair and makeup backstage at the Fendi autumn/winter 2014 fashion show. They then flew back to London and are now believed to be on vacation. Supportive: The Fast And Furious star hung out with her model squeeze backstage at Milan Fashion Week . Romantic getaway: It seems Michelle's girlfriend Cara Delevingne might be on the Thailand holiday too as that same day she shared a photo of herself wearing scuba diving gear while in a tropical location . Sexy couple: Michelle's post came days after Cara shared this snapshot . Michelle spoke openly about her sexuality in October after years of speculation, telling Entertainment Weekly, 'I've never walked the carpet with anyone, so they wonder: What does she do with her vagina?\" Plus, I play a butchy girl all the time, so they assume I'm a lesbo.' Asked about the assumptions, she admitted: 'Eh, they're not too far off. I've gone both ways. I do as I please. I am too f--king curious to sit here and not try when I can. Men are intriguing. So are chicks.' This week, Michelle posted a picture of herself naked, revealing her bare derriere to the world as she appeared to be meditating. She was seen lapping up the sunshine in Thailand, where she is . currently enjoying a getaway, and the snapshot also showed a stunning . ocean view. And it is likely that the photo was taken by Cara, as that same day the model shared a picture of herself clad . in scuba diving gear in an equally tropical location. Michelle’s snap comes just days after her model squeeze shared her own extremely sexy picture on the social networking site. The source added: 'You can see from the photos of them out together in London that they are clearly having fun. 'They . don't seem to have a care in the world and I know Michelle will pay for . everything, go everywhere with her and has unlimited funds to do as . they please. 'To begin with . this will be nice and she will be flattered. But when she has to go . away to shoot a film, it will end and Michelle does fall hard. 'And maybe it will all be a little too much for someone as young as Cara.' Turning heads: Michelle attended the BAFTAs in London earlier this month in a silk and leather plunging gown . Blossoming relationship: Michelle and Cara debuted their romance last month at a New York Knicks game .",

Fast and Furious star who has asked to remain unnamed reveals how Michelle 35 is so besotted by Cara 21 that she has already told pals she would love a baby with her But while the actress is planning her future with Cara who is 14 years younger than her we can reveal the Mulberry models family is terrified of the influence the wayward star is having on the top model who has become the toast of the fashion industry Scroll down for videos Inseparable Before jetting to Italy Cara 21 and 35yearold Michelle were seen out on the town in London The start of something Model Cara Delevingne shared a kiss with openly bisexual actress Michelle Rodriguez as they sat courtside at the New York Knicks game at Madison Square Garden in January Baring all Michelle Rodriguez shared a photo on Instagram on Tuesday which showed her stark naked while meditating The source who Michelle regularly confides in said Michelle comes from a broken home and it has a lot to do with why she has found herself in trouble again and again throughout her life Constantly she pushes boundaries and has been in trouble with the law but really all of it is because she is desperate to be loved Her mom and dad separated when she was a child and ever since Michelle has been yearning for some stability in her life Sadly after years of dating older women and men like Olivier Martinez nothing seemed to work out for her But now Cara has come along who is so much younger than the women she normally dates but suddenly Michelle is happy again In recent years former Lost star Michelle who openly admits she is bisexual has endured a string of broken relationships after dating French heartthrob and SWAT costar Olivier Martinez Fast and Furious costar Vin Diesel as well as model Claudette Lali director Francesca De Sola and model Aleksandra Rastovic The source claims Michelle had a great thing going with Terminator 3 actress Kristanna Loken who strongly hinted to Advocate magazine that she was in a relationship with her in 2006 yet Michelle has never confirmed their relationship Kristanna wanted to come out as a couple Shes proud to be bisexual but Michelle wasnt ready to go public said the friend So instead of working it out Michelle ended it Smitten Michelle was linked with Terminator 3 actress Kristanna Loken who hinted the couple were in a relationship in 2006 Exlovers Michelle Rodriguez iis said to have dated flimmaker Francesca de Sola The pair are pictured at the screening of Francescas film 1ers in New York in April 2013 Then she was left heartbroken a year later when she fell for another modelactress only to find out she had slept with someone else while she was away filming the movie Avatar The actress has also found herself behind bars after being in trouble repeatedly with the law In March 2002 she was charged with assault and harassment when her girlfriend Louise Ward claimed the tough girl had attacked her in their New Jersey apartment Ward was left battered and bruised but later dropped all charges against Michelle The friend said Michelle can be intense and dive head first into romances This can land her in hot water as she found out with Louise Over the last 15years there have been countless other examples of her disastrous love life Just one year later Michelle found herself in trouble again when she appeared in court to face eight misdemeanor charges relating to two driving incidents including a DUI and a hit and run In 2004 she pleaded no contest to three of the charges hit and run drunken driving and driving with a suspended license and went to jail for 48 hours and was placed on probation for three years And in 2005 while filming ABC hit Lost in Hawaii the stunning brunette was fined multiple times for speeding Later that year on December 1st she was arrested for drunk driving to which she pleaded guilty and paid a 500 fine and spent five days in jail Due to this being a clear violation of her earlier drunk driving crimes she was also sentenced to 60 days in jail but due to overcrowding was released on the same day she entered And its precisely this behavior that has left Caras family a little fearful Michelles close friend admitted Shes a very free spirit and before this relationship she has always been terrified of commitment And because of her troubled past many of them have essentially had to be her babysitter or a mother figure to her So now Cara might be younger than her but she honestly thinks this is the one Just before she met Cara she was talking about wanting a family within the next couple of years Lovers Michelle Rodriguez reportedly dated Vin Diesel her Fast and Furious costar The pair pose at the premiere of Fast and Furious 6 in Seoul South Korea in May 2013 Exlove Michelle Rodriguez was also said to have dated her SWAT costar Olivier Martinez The actor is now married to Halle Berry She really wants a baby and wants one soon and now she has found Cara she thinks this could finally be the time to chase that dream Sadly due to Michelles troubled past Caras family are not so sureThey are not 100 per cent pro this relationship and are in some ways willing it to end The 14year age gap between the girls concerns them as does Michelles wayward reputation They know Cara has been swept off her feet by Michelle who has dropped everything to be with her young love but the family fear the relationship will end in nothing but disaster I highly doubt at 21yearsold Cara is ready to start a family She is no doubt currently smitten with Michelle who dropped everything including her girlfriend and friends to be with her But if anyone is going to get their heart broken in this relationship its going to be Michelle She will smother Cara and wants to be around her 24 hours a day The couple who apparently met in January were also seen attending Princes secret gig at Ronnie Scotts club on Monday February 17 and the Elle Style Awards the following evening before heading to Milan to close the autumnwinter fashion season They then hired a private jet last week to head to Milan Fashion Week where Cara had a busy schedule The pair were spotted in coordinating black outfits while carrying bags as they made their way to their airplane while the Brit beautys parents were also along for the trip After landing in Milan Michelle sat with her love as she sat in hair and makeup backstage at the Fendi autumnwinter 2014 fashion show They then flew back to London and are now believed to be on vacation Supportive The Fast And Furious star hung out with her model squeeze backstage at Milan Fashion Week Romantic getaway It seems Michelles girlfriend Cara Delevingne might be on the Thailand holiday too as that same day she shared a photo of herself wearing scuba diving gear while in a tropical location Sexy couple Michelles post came days after Cara shared this snapshot Michelle spoke openly about her sexuality in October after years of speculation telling Entertainment Weekly Ive never walked the carpet with anyone so they wonder What does she do with her vagina Plus I play a butchy girl all the time so they assume Im a lesbo Asked about the assumptions she admitted Eh theyre not too far off Ive gone both ways I do as I please I am too fking curious to sit here and not try when I can Men are intriguing So are chicks This week Michelle posted a picture of herself naked revealing her bare derriere to the world as she appeared to be meditating She was seen lapping up the sunshine in Thailand where she is currently enjoying a getaway and the snapshot also showed a stunning ocean view And it is likely that the photo was taken by Cara as that same day the model shared a picture of herself clad in scuba diving gear in an equally tropical location Michelles snap comes just days after her model squeeze shared her own extremely sexy picture on the social networking site The source added You can see from the photos of them out together in London that they are clearly having fun They dont seem to have a care in the world and I know Michelle will pay for everything go everywhere with her and has unlimited funds to do as they please To begin with this will be nice and she will be flattered But when she has to go away to shoot a film it will end and Michelle does fall hard And maybe it will all be a little too much for someone as young as Cara Turning heads Michelle attended the BAFTAs in London earlier this month in a silk and leather plunging gown Blossoming relationship Michelle and Cara debuted their romance last month at a New York Knicks game"

He added: 'I have always loved . Christmas. Having the Christmas lights with the community coming in and . sharing it is a time when you get to know people you probably should . know better, I guess.'

Dazzling: The wiring for the display is 31 miles long. If there were any more lights the family would need a generator to run it .",

         "John Yates, 59, pictured outside court today, met Ukrainian Marina Ivleva, 49, online but their marriage ended acrimoniously . An internet bride who made her fortune in the UK after marrying a British man she met online is now fighting her in the divorce courts for a 'fair share' of her wealth. Ukrainian Marina Ivleva, 49, left Crimea for Leicester in 1999 after meeting John Yates through an international dating site and went on to earn more than he did. She had left for Britain for love and a better financial future because the average annual wage can be as low as £2,000-a-year at home. In her 12-years in the UK she has risen to a senior administrator at De Montfort University and amassed assets and cash. Now her truck-driving husband, who lives in a council house after they split two years ago, is taking her to court because he claims he deserves the 'fair share' of her wealth. Mrs Ivleva is living in their home in Leicester with her grown up son from a previous marriage, Robert, 26. Mr Yates says he is languishing with 'nothing' in council accommodation and insists he is due a 'fair share' of her money. The Court of Appeal heard that Mrs Ivleva told Mr Yates that she had divorced him in Ukraine, and this has sparked a bitter legal battle. She then tried to get her foreign divorce recognised in England in March but High Court judge Mr Justice Peter Jackson refused. He said that Mrs Ivleva had 'trailed her coat' by keeping her husband in the dark about details of the Ukrainian proceedings until it was too late for him to do anything about them. Describing their relationship as a 'limping marriage', he said 'basic fairness' to Mr Yates demanded that he be given the opportunity to divorce his wife in England. In his 'emphatic' ruling, the judge said that, although the divorce had been advertised in a Ukrainian newspaper, Mr Yates spoke very little of his wife's native language. In the latest legal skirmish Mrs Ivleva's son spoke on her behalf as she challenged the judge's decision at the Court of Appeal. Split: The couple, pictured together in 2005, broke up two years ago and Mrs Ivleva has claimed that she already secured a divorce in Ukraine - but the British court won't accept it . She claimed to have suffered discrimination as a foreign wife and that the ruling amounted to an 'attack on the integrity' of the Ukrainian courts. However, sitting judge Lady Justice King sided with Mr Yates and described the judge's refusal to recognise her Ukrainian divorce as 'exemplary' and 'unimpeachable'. The ruling opened the way for Mr Yates to pursue his county court divorce petition and seek financial orders against his wife. He said outside court after the ruling: 'She's got everything. I've got nothing and I'm entitled to a fair share. 'I'm living in council accommodation from day-to-day. She can afford to go on holiday. I can't'. He added that he expected his decree nisi to go through on January 5, finally ending his marriage.",

         "Whoopi Goldberg had her The View co-hosts all rallied against her during a discussion in which she supported a highly controversial discipline technique in the third episode of the revamped series Wednesday. With Nicolle Wallace, Rosie O'Donnell and Rosie Perez all shaking their heads in abject disapproval, Whoopi sided with a Michigan dad who recently forced his 4-year-old son to humiliate himself on a roadside with a sign that read 'I hit little girls.' 'That father took a great step and I'm proud of him,' Whoopi said of the man who could lose custody of his son for the stunt. Scroll down for video... Whose side are you on? Whoopi thinks a Michigan man who punished his 4-year-old by forcing him to hold up a humiliating sign was in the right . Rosie Perez was first to shun what Rob Devine forced his son Tristan to do. 'He's a little kid,' the actress asserted, raising her signature voice for one of the first times since joining the show. 'He's 4-years-old, it's a little bit extreme.' Whoopi wouldn't back down, though, so former George W. Bush aide Nicolle Wallace put in her two-cents. 'I don't think you teach a kid a lesson by shaming,' said the communications maven. Then, as if to make amends for the rift that emerged between them on Tuesday, a miracle happened: resident fiery liberal Rosie O'Donnell agree with Wallace. 'Shame is never a way to teach a child anything' said O'Donnell, whose own special-needs son once grappled with a hitting problem before the family sought therapy. 'They're not emotionally ready to understand.' But even in an episode where the panel touched on the Adrian Peterson child abuse issue and selfies in the gynecologist's office, day three was a departure from day two when Wallace and O'Donnell shared some seriously tens . Disagreement: It was Whoopi's turn to anger the group on Wednesday as she sided with a father with some controversial thoughts on displinine . Whoopi agreed: The creative punishment used by Rob Devine (right) when he discovered his son Tristan had been harassing female classmates became a source of a classic The View clash. Nicolle and both Rosies said 4-year-old is too young to humiliate a child . The once-booted co-host compared a characterization Wallace made of Obama's lack of warmth with the 'international incident' that came when rapper Kanye West publicly declared that Bush's response (or lack thereof) to the Katrina disaster meant he hated black people. 'He revealed was how personally wounded he was by that statement,' Wallace said of her then boss, who wrote of his dismay over West's assertion in his 2010 memoir Decision Points. She then called O'Donnell's words 'an attack.' O'Donnell snatched the opportunity to turn Wallace's words against her. 'He was very upset in the plane as he flew over Katrina,' quipped the comedienne. 'It was a very long time before he showed up. That is a fact, not an attack.' Wallace, who just the day before admitted on the show that she had nothing to do with Bush's decision not to visit Katrina--but simply fly over it--was forced to agree. Ironically, on the season's same inaugural episode, O'Donnell made sure to say of Wallace: 'I like her, I swear!' Whether that's true or not, the hot and cold chemistry appears to have worked, at least for the time being. The season 15 premier on Monday won the show its highest ratings in eight years. According to The Wrap, it's the second most watched premier ever for the daytime series. More to come? Republican Nicolle Wallace and liberal Rosie O'Donnell traded some harsh words during a very tense moment on just the second episode of The View's new lineup .",

         "One of the most fascinating aspects of Kevin Pietersen’s autobiography for the public must be the revealing of all the frailties and insecurities professional sportsmen feel in the dressing room. It’s certainly not as harmonious or lovey-dovey as people might presume. Players are always getting on each other’s nerves or having issues to resolve. You hear professional footballers whingeing if they are away for longer than a couple of weeks at a World Cup but international cricketers are away from home for months on end and see more of their team-mates than their families. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Pietersen say a good coach would have managed the situation . Kevin Pietersen has lifted the lid on all the frailties and insecurities in the dressing room . There will always be tensions, particularly when you consider the highly-pressurised environment they work in and that every move they make is scrutinised and analysed. The Manchester United footballers Teddy Sheringham and Andy Cole famously didn’t get on and in my England team Darren Gough and Andy Caddick had their moments, but that doesn’t really matter. As I said in these pages the other day, Michael Holding will tell you that some members of the great West Indies side didn’t get on. Shane Warne will say the same about his Australian team. But once they stepped on that field they respected each other and did everything in their power to win the game for their team. I liken it to sitting an examination every day of the week, and we all know how nervous and tetchy our kids can be the day before an exam. It is why there will always be niggles between team-mates and why they won’t always get on. Team-mates Teddy Sheringham and Andy Cole famously didn't get on at Manchester United . I’ve heard about the accusation of cliques in the England dressing room but that has always been the case and always will be. There will always be groups of three or four players who prefer to spend time with each other. When you are away for three months, you can’t expect everyone to go out together every night. You have to treat players like adults and in return they must have respect for one another even if they are not mates. There was plenty of banter and mickey-taking in the England dressing room when I played but someone like Marcus Trescothick, perhaps because he was teased about his weight when he was young, was always good at reminding anyone to be careful about not crossing the line. Rarely would we have a go at each other about cricketing mistakes because it was all so important but Mike Atherton, for one, would always remind me if I got out to a bad shot. It was just that he would wait a few days before doing so. Darren Gough (left) and Andy Caddick had their moments when Nasser Hussain was England captain . That is not bullying to me and I can honestly say I have never considered any cross words or mickey-taking in any England team I have played in — or watched — to be bullying. Yes, the England team is a tough school but if you can’t cope with a few tough words from your team-mates how are you going to cope with Mitchell Johnson and Brad Haddin? But I do agree with some of what Pietersen has said. I have long disagreed with how often the England bowlers would have a go at anyone who misfielded or dropped a catch and I was amazed at how long that was allowed to continue. Apart from anything else it plays into the hands of the opposition. They will look at that and say: ‘We’ve got this lot on the run. They are at each other.’ It just wasn’t a good look and I’m glad that there seems less of that sort of thing now. Nasser Hussain tried to embrace ‘difficult characters' like Phil Tufnell when he was England captain . And if it is true that people had to stand up in front of the group and apologise when they made a mistake then England should be careful. That really is school yard stuff. The flip side is that you want your team to be challenged and pushed to make sure they perform to the best of their ability, and it is not always the captain or the coach who does the challenging. For me, it would hit a lot harder if one of my team-mates, rather than the coach or captain, had a word with me after something and said: ‘Come on Nas, you can do better than that.’ Clearly, this England team pushed each other hard and it seems Pietersen didn’t like to be treated in that way. It does seem that England may have had a tendency to overdo the methods that took them to three Ashes triumphs and No 1 in the world Test rankings. The admonishing of players in the field is one example. Another is their reliance on statistics when, at times, they should have trusted their cricketing instinct more. When I was captain I would try to embrace the so-called ‘difficult characters’ and do everything to concentrate on what they could do rather than what they couldn’t. If people like Phil Tufnell, Caddick and Graham Thorpe could take wickets and score runs for us then they were fine by me. Andy Flower (right) tried to keep KP onside so England would benefit from his considerable talent . You have to treat everyone differently. Pietersen and Alastair Cook have almost identical career records and are two of the best batsmen England have ever had, but as human beings they could not be more different and have to be treated as such. The key with KP, clearly, was trying to keep him happy and make him feel loved. But coach Andy Flower will tell you he did that for five years, he treated Pietersen differently and did everything to manage him and get him onside so England would benefit from the match-winning innings of which he was capable. It’s all very well people saying Kevin was easy to manage when he first came into the side but he would have been wouldn’t he? He was a young player finding his way and there’s no way he would have challenged anyone senior. Pietersen's lucrative contract with Indian Premier League had repercussions for England team . Where everything clearly changed is with the advent of the Indian Premier League. It seemed to make Pietersen believe he was bigger than the team, and perhaps other players became jealous of the money he was making. The dynamic of one of the most successful of all England teams clearly changed. Flower had tired of repeatedly trying to manage Pietersen. When results started going against England and their star batsman was not quite looking like the player he once was, England decided enough was enough. As I have said, there are some valid points here but nearly everyone who has tried to manage him has found him incredibly hard work. Everybody can’t be wrong. So maybe one day Kevin Pietersen might take a look at himself rather than blaming everyone else for the way he has been treated by England. He might have to look back and say: ‘Was it me?’",

particularly when you consider the highlypressurised environment they work in and that every move they make is scrutinised and analysed The Manchester United footballers Teddy Sheringham and Andy Cole famously didnt get on and in my England team Darren Gough and Andy Caddick had their moments but that doesnt really matter As I said in these pages the other day Michael Holding will tell you that some members of the great West Indies side didnt get on Shane Warne will say the same about his Australian team But once they stepped on that field they respected each other and did everything in their power to win the game for their team I liken it to sitting an examination every day of the week and we all know how nervous and tetchy our kids can be the day before an exam It is why there will always be niggles between teammates and why they wont always get on Teammates Teddy Sheringham and Andy Cole famously didnt get on at Manchester United Ive heard about the accusation of cliques in the England dressing room but that has always been the case and always will be There will always be groups of three or four players who prefer to spend time with each other When you are away for three months you cant expect everyone to go out together every night You have to treat players like adults and in return they must have respect for one another even if they are not mates There was plenty of banter and mickeytaking in the England dressing room when I played but someone like Marcus Trescothick perhaps because he was teased about his weight when he was young was always good at reminding anyone to be careful about not crossing the line Rarely would we have a go at each other about cricketing mistakes because it was all so important but Mike Atherton for one would always remind me if I got out to a bad shot It was just that he would wait a few days before doing so Darren Gough left and Andy Caddick had their moments when Nasser Hussain was England captain That is not bullying to me and I can honestly say I have never considered any cross words or mickeytaking in any England team I have played in or watched to be bullying Yes the England team is a tough school but if you cant cope with a few tough words from your teammates how are you going to cope with Mitchell Johnson and Brad Haddin But I do agree with some of what Pietersen has said I have long disagreed with how often the England bowlers would have a go at anyone who misfielded or dropped a catch and I was amazed at how long that was allowed to continue Apart from anything else it plays into the hands of the opposition They will look at that and say Weve got this lot on the run They are at each other It just wasnt a good look and Im glad that there seems less of that sort of thing now Nasser Hussain tried to embrace difficult characters like Phil Tufnell when he was England captain And if it is true that people had to stand up in front of the group and apologise when they made a mistake then England should be careful That really is school yard stuff The flip side is that you want your team to be challenged and pushed to make sure they perform to the best of their ability and it is not always the captain or the coach who does the challenging For me it would hit a lot harder if one of my teammates rather than the coach or captain had a word with me after something and said Come on Nas you can do better than that Clearly this England team pushed each other hard and it seems Pietersen didnt like to be treated in that way It does seem that England may have had a tendency to overdo the methods that took them to three Ashes triumphs and No 1 in the world Test rankings The admonishing of players in the field is one example Another is their reliance on statistics when at times they should have trusted their cricketing instinct more When I was captain I would try to embrace the socalled difficult characters and do everything to concentrate on what they could do rather than what they couldnt If people like Phil Tufnell Caddick and Graham Thorpe could take wickets and score runs for us then they were fine by me Andy Flower right tried to keep KP onside so England would benefit from his considerable talent You have to treat everyone differently Pietersen and Alastair Cook have almost identical career records and are two of the best batsmen England have ever had but as human beings they could not be more different and have to be treated as such The key with KP clearly was trying to keep him happy and make him feel loved But coach Andy Flower will tell you he did that for five years he treated Pietersen differently and did everything to manage him and get him onside so England would benefit from the matchwinning innings of which he was capable Its all very well people saying Kevin was easy to manage when he first came into the side but he would have been wouldnt he He was a young player finding his way and theres no way he would have challenged anyone senior Pietersens lucrative contract with Indian Premier League had repercussions for England team Where everything clearly changed is with the advent of the Indian Premier League It seemed to make Pietersen believe he was bigger than the team and perhaps other players became jealous of the money he was making The dynamic of one of the most successful of all England teams clearly changed Flower had tired of repeatedly trying to manage Pietersen When results started going against England and their star batsman was not quite looking like the player he once was England decided enough was enough As I have said there are some valid points here but nearly everyone who has tried to manage him has found him incredibly hard work Everybody cant be wrong So maybe one day Kevin Pietersen might take a look at himself rather than blaming everyone else for the way he has been treated by England He might have to look back and say Was it me"

         "By . Daily Mail Reporter . Soviet spies have admitted using bugging devices on the Royal Family and former British Prime Minister Harold Wilson. Secret agents from the KGB targeted Princess Margaret in the 1960s, attaching listening aids to her lighter, cigarette case, ashtrays and telephones. According to the Sunday Express, they homed in on the Princess during a trip to Copenhagen, Denmark in 1964. Lord Snowdon And Princess Margaret get ready to board a plane in September 1964 ahead of their visit to Copenhagen. Russian spies have admitted bugging the Princess on the trip . Until now, Russia has always denied the covert operation, which took place in a hotel, but has now admitted compiling a dossier on the Princess's love affair with Robin Douglas-Home and further relationships with Roddy Llewellyn, Colin Tennant and Dominic Ewes, a painter who later committed suicide. Spies passed photos, tape recordings and 'most interesting, even scandalous' gossip involving senior royal figures. It is also said agents tried to get information from Margaret's therapist, Kay Kiernan, who also treated the Queen. Intelligence on Prince Phillip was gathered via society osteopath and artist Stephen Ward, who later killed himself at the height of the Profumo affair. But spies failed in a sting operation on then future leader Harold Wilson, setting up a 'honey trap' for him in a Moscow hotel. Princess Margaret (second from right and then left) was targeted by KGB spies on her visit to Copenhagen in 1964. Bugging devices were planted in her lighter, cigarette case, ashtrays and telephones . A new book will detail the KGB spies' attempts at bugging the Royal Family. Pictured, the Kremlin, in Moscow . Female agents posing as prostitutes patrolled the hotel overlooking the Kremlin, with a camera planted in a chandelier in his bedroom. But when the film was developed, Wilson's face was disguised. Colonel Vadim Goncharov, who has since died, was the KGB chief in charge of the snooping operations, and he was ordered by bosses to go on television to deny the claims, fearing they would cast a shadow over the Queen's first and only visit to Russia in 1994. But last week Russia newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda boasted that among Goncharov's successes was 'the bugging of drunken parties of the British Princess Margaret'. A book published next year, Entitled The Kremlin v The Windsors, by the paper's intelligence analyst Gennady Sokolov will provide further details of the operation, according to the paper. Master spy Goncharov, who staged stings in more than 100 countries and survived assassination attempts, said of the Princess Margaret operation: 'As I recall there were no lovers, though there was a visitor. 'On this occasion our interest was in getting confidential information which would open certain doors for us in Britain.' On the failed attempt at trapping Wilson, he said: 'It was if he was playing games with us.'",

         "County Kildare, Ireland (CNN) -- The mayor of a town in Ireland has resigned and faces a possible police investigation after saying he would no longer represent people of black African origin. Councillor Darren Scully was Mayor of Naas in County Kildare, near the Irish capital, Dublin. Interviewed on local radio Tuesday morning, Scully said he had decided not to represent black Africans because of their \"aggressive\" attitude to him. \"I have been met with aggressiveness, I have been met with bad manners,\" he claimed. \"I have also been played the race card - it's been said 'Oh yeah, you will help white people, but you don't help black people'.\" The then mayor continued: \"After a while I made a decision that I was just not going to take on representations from black Africans, that I would be very courteous to them and I would pass on their query to other public representatives who would take their concerns.\" Members of other political parties called for Scully to resign and Tuesday evening he did just that. He issued the following statement: \"I wish to apologise unreservedly for my remarks on 4FM and KFM. I realise they have caused deep hurt and offence in all communities and in all sectors of society. \"I have been proud to be Mayor of Naas and to represent all the people of the town. However, as a result of the upset that I have caused, I feel it is appropriate that I step down from this position.\" Earlier, political rivals Sinn Fein had accused him of being racist, but in his statement Scully denied the claim. He said: \"I realise now that my remarks were open to an interpretation that I did not intend. I abhor racism in all its forms.\" Naas Town Council had called a special meeting for Tuesday evening to discuss the controversy, but Scully resigned just ahead of it. The now ex-mayor is a member of the main party in the Irish coalition government - Fine Gael - but said he was expressing personal views. The party agreed - Fine Gael issued this statement: \"The views expressed by Cllr Scully do not reflect the views of Fine Gael and they are not party policy. \"Fine Gael is an inclusive party and we are trying to build a country that caters for all.\" A lawmaker with the junior partners in the coalition government, Aodhan O Riordain of the Labour Party, said he had reported the matter to Irish police with a view to prosecution. O Riordain branded Scully's comments \"outrageous\" and said they could be considered as incitement to hatred. The Irish census of 2006 showed there were 1,862 people of African origin living in Kildare out of a population in the county of 186,335, according to the Central Statistics Office in Dublin. Naas has a total population of just over 20,000. Local people told CNN Tuesday that race relations in the town are good and they were \"really surprised\" a local representative would make such comments.",

         "By . Suzannah Hills . Cuba's reclusive former President Fidel Castro has been photographed in public for the first time in almost a year. The revolutionary leader attended the inauguration of an art gallery in Havana run by Cuban artist Alexis Leyva, aka Kcho, yesterday. It is the first time Castro has been seen in public since attending a National Assembly meeting in February 2013. Public appearance: Fidel Castro, Cuba's former President and revolutionary leader, looks at the camera during a rare public appearance to attend the inauguration of an art gallery in Havana, Cuba . Support: Castro is helped into the gallery by an aide and a metal walking stick . Castro, who ceded power to his brother Raul Castro in 2008 after falling ill in 2006, has kept a low profile in recent years. But his silence in the wake of Nelson Mandela's death prompted widespread speculation that his health is ailing. The former South African president was a close ally, thanks to Cuba's backing of Angolan fighters who battled forces supported by the previous pro-apartheid South African government of the 1980s. This prompted the release of pictures in December of Castro meeting with a Spanish reporter about current events for more than two hours earlier that month. Recluse: The appearance is the first time Castro has been seen in public since attending a National Assembly meeting in February 2013 . Speculation: Castro's low profile prompted fears about the state of his health . The photo shows Castro, 87, seated and wearing a blue sweatsuit, looking intensely at writer Ignacio Ramonet and gesturing with his left hand. Mr Ramonet and the website Cubadebate say the photo was taken early December. The reporter told the AP that he and Castro discussed a wide range of topics including Mandela, Venezuelan politics and climate change. 'I found him to be in excellent health and in a good mood, physically, mentally and psychologically,' Mr Ramonet said. Castro left power after 47 years after suffering serious intestinal bleeding in 2006, handing his duties to his brother Raul. Castro looks closely at an art piece during a rare public appearance to attend the inauguration of an art gallery run by Cuban artist Alexis Leyva, aka Kcho . Poor health: Castro left power after 47 years after suffering serious intestinal bleeding in 2006 . While Fidel Castro has been out of the spotlight due to his health, his brother Raul has been making enough headlines for them both as he caused a stir after shaking President Obama's hand during the public memorial ceremony for Mandela in South Africa. It then emerged that representatives from the two historically antagonistic nations had already been in talks for six months. During the president's trip back from South Africa, Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes told reporters on Air Force One that 'it's been quite some time since the Presidents of the United States and Cuba were even in the same place.' But he acknowledged that 'we’re in talks on issues associated with migration that, again, I think allow for there to be greater connectivity particularly among Cuban Americans and Cuba.' Castro ceded power to his brother Raul Castro in 2008 and has kept a low profile ever since . Official pictures have been released of Castro in recent months to quell the mounting speculation over his health .",

         "A devastated son whose father was beheaded and his mother abducted a week ago today said he now hopes she is dead to ‘ease her suffering’ as it is too unbearable to think of her in pain. Retired Russell Dermond’s decapitated body was found at his exclusive, lake-front home last Tuesday, but his wife of 62 years Shirley has vanished, in a suspected kidnapping. Investigators in Putnam County, Georgia are completely baffled by the gruesome crime and no one can understand why anyone would want to harm the beloved elderly couple. Nothing was taken from their $1m home, their car keys and cellphones were left behind. Scroll down for video . Unspeakable: Shirley Dermond, 87, has not been seen for more than a week after her husband's decapitated body was found at their home. Their son, Keith, said: 'If she is still alive, we can’t imagine . what she is going through… but it . has almost got to the stage where we hope she is with our father, just . to ease her suffering' Mystery: No-one has been able to think of why anyone would want to harm Shirley and Russell. Nothing was taken, their cellphones and car keys were left behind. Police have ruled out a mob hit and that Russell was in witness protection. And their family they can't believe it is linked to the drug murder of son, Mark, in 2000 . The police have been forced to deny they were taken out in a mob hit and their despairing family have also denied their is any link between the horror and the killing of one of the couple's son's in a drug deal gone wrong. Officers have been dredging a nearby lake and searching woods for clues, but as yet the local Sheriff says they have no leads. They still haven’t found 88-year-old Mr Dermond’s severed head. One of the Dermond’s three heartbroken children, Keith said the family had been wracking their brains to try to come up with any possible motive, but they say their parents didn’t have a single enemy in the world. He is still desperate for the safe return of his 87-year-old mother, but the idea of her suffering at the hands of a, ‘sick’ murderer is just too much for him to bear. Speaking to MailOnline, Keith, 55, from Jacksonville, Florida, said: ‘We are completely devastated, but our primary focus is finding our mother. The thought of her suffering is just unbearable. ‘Each hour that goes by, my brother, my sister and me are becoming more resigned to the fact that we may never see her again and we may never know what happened. ‘If she is still alive, we can’t imagine what she is going through. The human spirit is incredibly strong… but it has almost got to the stage where we hope she is with our father, just to ease her suffering. ‘Whoever did this was so sick in the head that I just can’t imagine it.’ Sick: Keith, pictured center left with wife Kathleen and other family members, said: 'The more we think about it, the more it makes sense that this was just some sick individual who randomly targeted them.' He added it could have been the work of a cult . Russell Dermond was last seen May 1 at a supermarket not far from his home in the gated Reynolds Plantation east of Atlanta. Shirley Dermond had started the next day’s newspaper crossword puzzle, but no one had taken the couple’s May 3 mail out of their mailbox. That same day, last Saturday, the Dermonds failed to show up at a friend’s Kentucky Derby party. According to Putnam County Sheriff, Howard Sills, financial and phone records have not turned up anything to suggest the Dermonds would be the target of criminal activity. Since the murder speculation about a potential motive has been rife. Sheriff Sills has been forced to deny rumors that Mr Dermond – whose body was found in his garage - was in a witness protection program and may have been killed by mobsters. He has also said there is no evidence that the brutal crime was in some way linked to the murder of the couple’s son Mark in a drug deal gone wrong in 2000. Mark was gunned down in Atlanta as he apparently tried to buy crack cocaine on his birthday. Troy Major was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment for murder. He was also hit with consecutive terms of 20 years for aggravated assault and five years for possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony. He has tried to appeal twice, but both attempts were denied. And Keith says that while his brother Brad, his sister Leslie and him have considered a possible link between their brother’s slaying and their father’s murder, It just doesn’t make sense. Isolated: Keith reckons they may have been targeted not because of their wealth - as they have richer neighbors either side, but because they live at the end of a cul-de-sac with no other houses that close . Discovery: Officers dredge a lake during the search for Shirley Dermond. Her body was found by a fisherman . He said: ‘People have tried to link this to my brother’s murder. We have obviously thought about that, because it is a violent connection to my parents, but that doesn’t make sense either. ‘The individual is still in jail and anyway, my parents weren’t really involved in the case at the time. They didn’t attend court, so if this was some kind of revenge, they would not be obvious targets. ‘It is a complete mystery as far as we are concerned. We have been wracking our brains trying to think of anyone who may have wanted to do this, but we have no idea. ‘My father hadn’t been in business for 20 years. He just spent his time relaxing and playing golf. He just didn’t have any enemies. ‘The more we think about it, the more it makes sense that this was just some sick individual who randomly targeted them. ‘My parents live at the end of a cul-de-sac, so they have no neighbors either side. Maybe that’s why they were targeted? ‘It could have been anything, something to do with a cult, we just don’t know. There were definitely people in that neighborhood who would be more obvious targets if it was a robbery. My parents were comfortable, but they definitely weren’t wealthy.’ Keith and his siblings initially flew to Georgia to try to help with the investigation, but they have not been allowed in the house - where many happy family parties were held over the years - because it is still a crime scene. Now they have returned home where they are playing an unbearable waiting game, desperately hoping for news about their mother one way or the other. And heartbreakingly, Sheriff Howard Sills has said he is not optimistic she’ll be found alive. Speaking on Tuesday, he said: ‘I’m running down one thing after another and coming up empty.’ There was speculation that an elderly woman who turned up dazed and confused Monday at a Tampa hospital was Shirley Dermond, but that has been completely dismissed. Concern: The alarm was raised when the couple failed to turn up to a Kentucky Derby party . And Sills said rumors of organized crime involvement are unfounded. He said: ‘No, the man wasn’t in witness protection. He wasn’t going to testify. There’s no evidence of any kind of torture.’ On Tuesday, they enlisted the aid of a Department of Natural Resources submarine robot to scour the deep peninsula off Lake Oconee outside the couple’s home. So far, they’ve turned up nothing. Sills said he had also dispatched deputies to a wooded area near the crime scene in the hope they would discover some kind of clue. Keith – who like his late father, manages a chain of restaurants - said: ‘The Sheriff is keeping us informed as much as he can. I spoke to him yesterday. He is holding back some information as it is important to the case. ‘The house is still a crime scene, they are looking for finger prints and dredging the lake, but there just doesn’t seem to be much in terms of leads.’ He added: ‘My parents were married for 62 years. Family was everything to them. Their happiest times were spent with us, that’s what they loved doing. We just pray someone who knows something comes forward and puts an end to all of this.’",
         "A devastated son whose father was beheaded and his mother abducted a week ago today said he now hopes she is dead to ease her suffering as it is too unbearable to think of her in pain Retired Russell Dermonds decapitated body was found at his exclusive lakefront home last Tuesday but his wife of 62 years Shirley has vanished in a suspected kidnapping Investigators in Putnam County Georgia are completely baffled by the gruesome crime and no one can understand why anyone would want to harm the beloved elderly couple Nothing was taken from their 1m home their car keys and cellphones were left behind Scroll down for video Unspeakable Shirley Dermond 87 has not been seen for more than a week after her husbands decapitated body was found at their home Their son Keith said If she is still alive we cant imagine what she is going through but it has almost got to the stage where we hope she is with our father just to ease her suffering Mystery Noone has been able to think of why anyone would want to harm Shirley and Russell Nothing was taken their cellphones and car keys were left behind Police have ruled out a mob hit and that Russell was in witness protection And their family they cant believe it is linked to the drug murder of son Mark in 2000 The police have been forced to deny they were taken out in a mob hit and their despairing family have also denied their is any link between the horror and the killing of one of the couples sons in a drug deal gone wrong Officers have been dredging a nearby lake and searching woods for clues but as yet the local Sheriff says they have no leads They still havent found 88yearold Mr Dermonds severed head One of the Dermonds three heartbroken children Keith said the family had been wracking their brains to try to come up with any possible motive but they say their parents didnt have a single enemy in the world He is still desperate for the safe return of his 87yearold mother but the idea of her suffering at the hands of a sick murderer is just too much for him to bear Speaking to MailOnline Keith 55 from Jacksonville Florida said We are completely devastated but our primary focus is finding our mother The thought of her suffering is just unbearable Each hour that goes by my brother my sister and me are becoming more resigned to the fact that we may never see her again and we may never know what happened If she is still alive we cant imagine what she is going through The human spirit is incredibly strong but it has almost got to the stage where we hope she is with our father just to ease her suffering Whoever did this was so sick in the head that I just cant imagine it Sick Keith pictured center left with wife Kathleen and other family members said The more we think about it the more it makes sense that this was just some sick individual who randomly targeted them He added it could have been the work of a cult Russell Dermond was last seen May 1 at a supermarket not far from his home in the gated Reynolds Plantation east of Atlanta Shirley Dermond had started the next days newspaper crossword puzzle but no one had taken the couples May 3 mail out of their mailbox That same day last Saturday the Dermonds failed to show up at a friends Kentucky Derby party According to Putnam County Sheriff Howard Sills financial and phone records have not turned up anything to suggest the Dermonds would be the target of criminal activity Since the murder speculation about a potential motive has been rife Sheriff Sills has been forced to deny rumors that Mr Dermond whose body was found in his garage was in a witness protection program and may have been killed by mobsters He has also said there is no evidence that the brutal crime was in some way linked to the murder of the couples son Mark in a drug deal gone wrong in 2000 Mark was gunned down in Atlanta as he apparently tried to buy crack cocaine on his birthday Troy Major was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment for murder He was also hit with consecutive terms of 20 years for aggravated assault and five years for possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony He has tried to appeal twice but both attempts were denied And Keith says that while his brother Brad his sister Leslie and him have considered a possible link between their brothers slaying and their fathers murder It just doesnt make sense Isolated Keith reckons they may have been targeted not because of their wealth as they have richer neighbors either side but because they live at the end of a culdesac with no other houses that close Discovery Officers dredge a lake during the search for Shirley Dermond Her body was found by a fisherman He said People have tried to link this to my brothers murder We have obviously thought about that because it is a violent connection to my parents but that doesnt make sense either The individual is still in jail and anyway my parents werent really involved in the case at the time They didnt attend court so if this was some kind of revenge they would not be obvious targets It is a complete mystery as far as we are concerned We have been wracking our brains trying to think of anyone who may have wanted to do this but we have no idea My father hadnt been in business for 20 years He just spent his time relaxing and playing golf He just didnt have any enemies The more we think about it the more it makes sense that this was just some sick individual who randomly targeted them My parents live at the end of a culdesac so they have no neighbors either side Maybe thats why they were targeted It could have been anything something to do with a cult we just dont know There were definitely people in that neighborhood who would be more obvious targets if it was a robbery My parents were comfortable but they definitely werent wealthy Keith and his siblings initially flew to Georgia to try to help with the investigation but they have not been allowed in the house where many happy

         "To call this XCOM would be a major disservice to one of the finest names in tactical gaming. For bar the well-realised time period, The Bureau: XCOM Declassified is nothing but another generic third-person shooter with XCOM elements uncomfortably shoe-horned in. Set in the 1960s, you play Agent William Carter – the leader of a three-man squad sent to investigate various alien attacks. Negative space: Gamplay gets repetitive very quickly - despite 2K's best efforts in enemy variation . To its credit, the uninspired combat holds up well. Using a Mass Effect-style command and abilities wheel spliced with a Gears of War cover-system, battles often involve sending your teammates down the flanks to draw fire, while you attack from the other side. Each of your squaddies have their own abilities – for example the Engineer can deploy a floating turret and the Sniper has a useful Critical shot. But where it falls down is in its implementation of a key XCOM principle – that being; when a character dies, they stay dead. Although your squad mates can die if not revived, main character Carter cannot – his fatality merely causing a respawn of the entire squad at the previous checkpoint. Thus, throughout the game’s 15-hour campaign, you never feel connected to the character in the same way you were your squad in XCOM: Enemy Unknown. There's no sense of urgency because you know a checkpoint is always there to save you. Sure, it’s slightly annoying when a high-level squadmate is downed, but they all have no personality or character – and are replaced by yet another bot from a limitless supply of AI-controlled drones. Weapons, too, have no wow factor. All seem slightly muted, with even the largest alien guns coming across as completely limp. Another element uncomfortably borrowed from Enemy Unknown is player choice, and it's commendable that The Bureau – given its frequent delays in development – has kept this element in. However, choices are too black and white often not presenting a moral dilemma but a clear cut: be nice, be nasty scenario. Wooden voice acting and average lip synching do the dialogue sections no favours, either. You can even run around The Bureau's HQ - but apart from the odd mini-game, it's incredibly dull. Boring: There are some nice touches but for the most part there's little to make The Bureau stand out . But by far the biggest nail in The Bureau’s coffin is the lack of co-operative multiplayer. In sticking so rigidly to the rules of the XCOM universe (that being, once your teammates die, they die), they’ve missed a golden opportunity to lift this game away from average. But even then, thrills would be predictable and offer nothing other titles – for example Gears of War – do better. The Bureau isn’t a bad game. It’s just average. And in this day and age, that can be the kiss of death. The Bureau: XCOM Declassified is out now. Let us know what you think on Twitter: @DailyMailGames and on Facebook: Daily Mail Games."

         "The Chinese authorities have banned the phrase 'big yellow duck' as an internet search item after a prankster substituted tanks for ducks in a doctored version of a world famous photograph taken during the Tiananmen massacre . China has begun an annual crackdown on efforts by families to commemorate the . victims of the Tiananmen Square massacre, 24 years after the . pro-democracy demonstrations were crushed by the People’s Liberation . Army. A number of internet search terms have been banned including 'tomorrow' \"today\", \"tonight\", \"June 4\" and other number combinations that might refer to what the Chinese call the June Fourth Incident . Scroll down for video . Censored: The Chinese authorities have banned the phrase 'big yellow duck' as an internet search item after a prankster substituted tanks for ducks in this doctored version of a world famous photograph . Tank man: The world famous image of a protestors standing in front of oncoming Chinese tanks during the 1989 protests . Popular: The doctored photograph is a reference to the 54-foot yellow duck created by Florentijn Hofman, which floats in Hong Kong's Victoria Harbour. This shows a copy of the duck in Tianjin, China . As reported by International Business Times, 'Big yellow duck' has also been censored as a search item. It comes after a user on Sina Weibo, a Chinese social network, posted a doctored version of the famous Jeff Widener's photograph of a protester confronting a line of tanks in the square. The doctored photograph instead features four ducks in row instead of the tanks. it was a reference to the 54-foot yellow duck created by Florentijn Hofman, . which floats in Hong Kong's Victoria Harbour. Families of the victims of the massacre have been barred from visiting their graves by more than a dozen Chinese police stationed outside the main 'Stone Gate' entrance to the Wanan graveyard where many of the victims are buried. The exact number of victims of the massacre on June 3-4 and the political crackdown which followed soon after is unknown but it is believed to run well into the hundreds if not more. Commemoration: Tens of thousands of people joined a candlelit vigil in Hong Kong to mark the anniversary of the Tiananmen Square protests today . Crowds: Demonstrators swarmed the city's Victoria Park in memory of the brutal crackdown carried out by the Chinese government . Freedom: The commemorations have only been allowed to take place in Hong Kong amidst heightened security in mainland China . Vibrant: Protesters brought a series of eye-catching banners aimed at undermining the government's anti-democratic policies . The Chinese Government considers the peaceful protest . by students and workers to have been a 'counter-revolutionary' revolt, . and has previously defended the decision to send in tanks and troops. It has never provided an official death toll. The move by Beijing is . part of a major push to suppress discussion of the massacre across China and Hong Kong, particularly online and around . certain parts of the capital. Security personnel were patrolling . the narrow streets close to Beijing's Forbidden City and outside the former . house of Zhao Ziyang, the Communist party secretary who was purged and . held under house arrest following the protests. Authorities have also detained or . enhanced surveillance on 10 prominent dissidents, according to the Hong . Kong-based advocacy group China Human Rights Defenders. Hardy: Protesters braved the elements to show their opposition to the military crackdown which killed the Chinese democracy movement . Passion: A man brandishes a candle as he protests next to a statue depicting the 'Goddess of Democracy' in Hong Kong . Moving: But in mainland China the authorities have blocked sensitive search terms to avoid controversy . Repression: Some protesters sat behind bars to symbolise the Chinese government's hardline authoritarian policies . Online . searches for a range of keywords on Sina Weibo, China's version of . Twitter, have been blocked, from ‘Tiananmen’ to ‘candle’, which has been used to . encourage digital vigils. Instead activists turned to overseas websites to commemorate the event and criticise authorities. ‘The . dispute in this country is basically stuck on whether to light a candle . or to extinguish it,’ dissident artist Ai Weiwei posted on Twitter. Rights . lawyer Liu Xiaoyuan said on Twitter that he had been blocked from Sina . Weibo for seven days for sharing 'sensitive information' -- urging . others to honour victims by posting an image of a lit candle. Forum: Participants at a discussion meeting in Victoria Park in front of a poster of Beijing's Tiananmen Square . Tributes: Wreaths left in Hong Kong to commemorate the iconic events of the 1989 protests . Security: There was a heavy police presence in Tiananmen Square itself to prevent the possibility of a memorial protest . A . mocked-up picture was circulating online of the 1989 ‘Tank Man’ photograph of a civilian staring down a long row of tanks headed toward . Tiananmen Square -- with the military vehicles replaced by plastic . ducks. The image could not be found on domestic websites within the . ‘Great Firewall of China’ as the country's system of internet controls . is known. The high-profile dissident Hu Jia wrote on Twitter the . broad crackdown on discussion of Tiananmen demonstrated the . government's weakness. The event underscored the ruling Communist . Party's ‘illegal nature’, he wrote. ‘The unprecedentedly high pressure . for the 24th anniversary of June 4 actually reveals the authorities' fear.’ Contrast: Chinese tourists in the square seemed carefree today; many are unaware of what happened in 1989 . Innocent: A little girl holding the Chinese national flag dances in Tainanmen Square as the portrait of Chairman Mao looks on . Over the weekend China accused the US of 'prejudice' after it urged Beijing to provide a full account of the crackdown on activists after the Tiananmen Square protests. Foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei said the US should 'stop interfering in China's internal affairs'. The Chinese authorities had already reached a 'clear conclusion' about the Tiananmen Square protests, he added. On Friday, the US state department said the 24th anniversary of the 'violent suppression of demonstrations in Tiananmen Square' prompted it to remember this 'tragic loss of innocent lives'."

         "Stephen Hawking recently said that the development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race. Now, Google chief executive, Eric Schmidt has weighed into the discussion, arguing that there is no need to fear AI, and it could even be the making of humanity. 'These concerns are normal,' he said onstage during the Financial Times Innovate America event in New York this week. 'They're also to some degree misguided.' Google chief executive, Eric Schmidt, says there is no need to fear AI, and it could be the making of humanity . The Google chief, who is involved in the development of AI in applications such as self-driving cars, also says that the fear of robots stealing human jobs is unwarranted. 'There's lots of evidence that when computers show up, wages go up,' he said, according to a report by Issie Lapowsky in Wired. 'There's lots of evidence that people who work with computers are paid more than people without.' He argues that machines are far more simplistic that people believe. He used the example of an experiment Google conducted a few years ago on a computer 'neural network'. The Google chief, who is involved in the development of AI in applications such as self-driving cars (pictured), also says that the fear of robots stealing human jobs is unwarranted . Eric Schmidt's comments (right) following a warning by Professor Stephen Hawking (left) that humanity faces an uncertain future as technology learns to think for itself and adapt to its environment . During the test, company's scientists used and artificial neural network and inputted 11,000 hours of YouTube videos to see what it could learn, without any training. 'It discovered the concept of \"cat\",' Schmidt said. 'I'm not quite sure what to say about that, except that that's where we are.' With Google at the forefront of AI development, Eric Schmidt has a lot to gain from public acceptance of the technology. Our desire to create helpful digital assistants and self-driving vehicles could bring about our demise. Professor Stephen Hawking has again warned that humanity faces an uncertain future as technology learns to think for itself and adapt to its environment. Speaking at event in London, the physicist told the BBC that: 'The development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race.' This echoes claims he made earlier in the year when he said success in creating AI 'would be the biggest event in human history,  unfortunately, it might also be the last.' He argues that developments in digital personal assistants Siri, Google Now and Cortana are merely symptoms of an IT arms race which 'pale against what the coming decades will bring.' But Professor Hawking noted that other potential benefits of this technology could also be significant, with the potential to eradicate, war, disease and poverty. 'Looking further ahead, there are no fundamental limits to what can be achieved,' continued Professor Hawking. 'There is no physical law precluding particles from being organised in ways that perform even more advanced computations than the arrangements of particles in human brains.' Google's DeepMind start-up, which was bought for £255 million ($400 million) earlier this year, is currently attempting to mimic the properties of the human brain's short-term working memory. By combining the way ordinary computers work with the way the human brain works, the artificial intelligence researchers hope the machine will learn to program itself. Described as a 'Neural Turing Machine', it learns as it stores memories, and later retrieve them to perform logical tasks beyond those it has been trained to do. The acquisition of DeepMind followed Google's recent purchase of seven robotics firms, including Meka, which makes humanoid robots, and Industrial Perception, which specialises in machines that can package goods, for example. In August, Google also revealed it had teamed up with two of Oxford University's artificial intelligence teams to help machines better understand users. 'It is a really exciting time for AI research these days, and progress is being made on many fronts including image recognition and natural language understanding,' wrote Demis Hassabis, co-founder of DeepMind and vice president of engineering at Google in a blog post. But despite these projects, and Schmidt's comments, Google is also aware of the dangers involved with AI and machine learning. So much so that in January it set up an ethics board to oversee its work in these fields. In fact, one of the original founders of Google's DeepMind warned artificial intelligence is the 'number 1 risk for this century,' and believes it could play a part in human extinction. 'Eventually, I think human extinction will probably occur, and technology will likely play a part in this,' DeepMind's Shane Legg said in an interview earlier this year. The ethics board, revealed by web site The Information, is to ensure the projects are not abused. Earlier this year, Elon Musk likened artificial intelligence to 'summoning the demon'. The Tesla and Space X founder previously warned that the technology could someday be more harmful than nuclear weapons.

In an open letter to customers, Apple’s chief executive Tim Cook announced the firm has changed the way encryption works in iOS 8. As a result the company can no longer bypass a user’s passcode, making it impossible for it to hand over data to law enforcement officers and governments. This is the case, even if a search warrant is served on the firm or customer. These new rules, however, only apply to data stored on the device, locked by a passcode, and Apple will be able to access data stored on iCloud if presented with a warrant for it. And because these new features only apply to iOS 8, data can be extracted where necessary on devices running older versions of the software, from iOS 4 to iOS 7, as has always been the case. Individuals interested in taking up the offer were given a short biography of the man's girlfriend, including details on her height, weight and hobbies. Wei Chu also made clear that the offer was in no way a sexual way - explaining that customers would be given the option to take his girlfriend on dinner or study dates. 'Service items include but are not restricted to: eating together, studying together, saving seats (in libraries/classrooms), three-person dates. Fees generated during dates should be split,' his placard read. Wei Chu's unorthodox entrepreneurship is just one extreme method of raising money to pay for the latest iPhone installment. Earlier this week, a Saudi Arabian man asked his future brother-in-law for an iPhone 6 as a dowry for marrying his sister, according to the International Business Times. Meanwhile, following the launch of the iPhone 5 last year, a Chinese couple were charged with human trafficking after admitting selling three of their newborn babies for £8,000 between 2008 and 2013 in order to pay for luxury items including an iPhone."

         "Beijing (CNN) -- Must art always serve politics? To audiences overseas, contemporary art in China is typified by Ai Weiwei, the most trenchant critic of China's artistic and political restrictions. But not all Chinese artists subscribe to Ai Weiwei's approach. Ai Jing (no relation), once a popular singer-songwriter, is back in Beijing from a long hiatus, this time representing one school of China's contemporary art scene. Her style is mostly uplifting and features politics as an afterthought, if at all. Small wonder, perhaps, that she is the first Chinese contemporary artist to hold an exhibition in the iconic National Museum of China, next to Tiananmen Square, which is better known for revolutionary history exhibits than modern art. Ai Jing's solo show opened just a few days after the Communist Party concluded its leadership transition in the Great Hall of the People, across the sprawling square. \"We chose Ai Jing based on our understanding of her artwork and of public expectation,\" said Chen LÃ¼sheng, the deputy director of the National Museum. \"We believe Ai Jing's art pieces will connect China's 5,000 years history with modern art.\" Chinese art-lovers know Ai Jing best as a pop singer and song-writer. The 43-year-old Ai has cut five albums since 1992, becoming a widely popular folk and pop singer in the 1990s. She moved to New York in 1997 and spent nearly a decade there honing her skills as an installation artist. Her work has been featured in several New York art galleries, including the Urban Art Infill, which exhibited her piece \"Sounds of New York\". Richard Vine, a New York-based art critic who has been visiting China since 2000, likes the universality of \"My Mom and My Hometown,\" a tapestry of woolen patches knitted by Ai's mother and bedecked with the English word \"LOVE\". \"It expands outwardly, first for the family, community, nation and then the world. With one piece like this, she is able to touch both poles,\" Vine said. Ai does not shy away from love's racier themes. One section shows square panels printed with \"I love sex,\" and \"love me, suck me.\" She looks at the darker side too. \"The Tree of Life,\" an installation art, depicts a lonely raven perched on a leafless oak tree made of disposable chopsticks. Her Warhol-inspired pop-art reproduces Marc Riboud's picture of \"Flower Girl,\" which shows a woman holding a flower in front of gun-toting soldiers during an anti-war march in the United States during the 1960s. \"We hope to present the public with multiple styles of modern art to show that not all art is the same,\" Chen of the National Museum said. \"Ai Jing may not be the most popular contemporary Chinese artist, but she is one of the most special.\" Ai Jing's works are typically wholesome and uplifting, unlike many Chinese contemporary art works now popular overseas. The paintings of Zeng Fanzhi, for example, are typically bold and edgy, sometimes dark -- and selling for millions of dollars in galleries and art auctions. (An art collector has called Zeng \"The Jackson Pollock of the 21st century.\") Lin Tianmiao is now known for her bold surrealism, using naked body casts of herself or building a walk-in human \"womb\" strewn with disfigured bodies. She recently had her work featured at Asia Society in New York. Also popular overseas are the irreverent creations of Ai Weiwei, some of which are blunt commentaries of what he sees are the dark side of life in China. \"We don't want extremist and esoteric pieces,\" Chen said. Ai Jing's message of love, he says, is what the Chinese public wants. Her theme of love may seem \"corny,\" art critic Richard Vine agreed, but \"it's not something that she is just falling into thoughtlessly. It's a very considered conviction that this is after all the best response to the difficulties of life.\""

         "By . Rachel Reilly . PUBLISHED: . 07:58 EST, 5 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 11:24 EST, 5 June 2013 . We will one day be able to talk to animals using mobile phone-sized gadgets, says a leading expert in animal behaviour. Professor Con Slobodchikoff is developing new technology that interprets the calls of the prairie dog and says the technology could eventually be used to interpret other animals. He also suggested that the technology could . one day be fine-tuned to enable humans to talk back to animals and engage in conversation. Professor Con Slobodchikoff says that dogs may be able to express a preference for certain foods using the new technology. He also hopes that communicating with them may help treat behavioural problems . In an interview with The Atlantic, Professor Slobodchikoff explained he is using new artificial intelligence (AI) software to record the calls of prairie dogs. He is then using the AI techniques to analyse the barks and translate them into English. He explained that from his research, he knew that prairie dogs warn other members of the pack about potential dangers in great detail – even describing a threat as being a ‘thin, brown coyote approaching quickly’. The professor, who has spent the past 30 years analysing the behaviour of animals, added: ‘I think we have the technology now to be able to develop the devices that are, say, the size of a cellphone, that would allow us to talk to our dogs and cats. The film Dr Doolittle may become a reality in less than a decade thanks to new technology . ‘So the dog says \"bark!\" and the device analyses it and says, \"I want to eat chicken tonight.\" 'Or the cat can say \"meow,\" and it can say, \"You haven't cleaned my litterbox recently\".' He estimated that it would take between five and ten years of extensive research to get to this point. If such technology became a reality, it would change the world, he explained: ‘Consider that, for example, 40 per cent of all households in America have dogs, 33 per cent have cats -- at least one cat, at least one dog. 'And consider that something like four million dogs are euthanised every year because of behavioural problems. 'Well, most problems are because of the lack of communication between animal and human. The human can't get across to the animal what the human expects, and the animal can't get across to the human what it's experiencing. 'And if we had a chance to talk back and forth, the dog could say, \"You're scaring me.\" And you could say, \"Well, I'm sorry, I didn't realise that I was scaring you. I'll give you more space.\" 'What I'm hoping, actually, is that down the road, we will be forming partnerships with animals, rather than exploiting animals.' He added that many people are afraid of animals or they have nothing to do with them because they don't think that animals have anything to contribute to their lives. He predicts that once people get to the point where they can start talking to animals, they'll realise that animals are living, breathing, thinking beings, and that they have much to contribute to people's lives. Professor Slobodchikoff explained he is using new artificial intelligence (AI) software to record the calls of prairie dogs. He is then using the AI techniques to analyse the barks and translate them into English. He explained that from his research, he knew that prairie dogs warn other members of the pack about potential dangers in great detail – even describing a threat as being a ‘thin, brown coyote approaching quickly’.The professor, who has spent the past 30 years analysing the behaviour of animals, added: ‘I think we have the technology now to be able to develop the devices that are, say, the size of a cellphone, that would allow us to talk to our dogs and cats. Previous attempts to help human understand animals include the BowLingual. The Japanese device claims to translate barks from dozens of different breeds of dogs, including mixed-breeds. Based on Dr. Matsumi Suzuki's Animal Emotion Analysis System developed at Japan Acoustic Laboratory, the device interprets barks and chooses one of 200 phrases that supposedly reflects what the the dog is saying. The device was successful enough to be brought to the American market, and was even named one of 2002's best inventions by Time Magazine. But reports of the BowLingual's accuracy have been mixed with popular product-review website Epinions giving it a low 1.5 star average. In 2003 the same company launched a follow-up product for cats called Meowlingual although this was less successful."

         "It's starred on Jeopardy, helped with cancer research and even worked in a call centre but now Watson’s next job is in the public’s hands. In February, the IBM Watson team asked firms to design mobile apps that take advantage of its supercomputer's processing power. Hundreds of submissions have now been narrowed down to 25 finalists, including an app that lets you speak to an avatar of a famous person, and one that offers advice for expectant mothers. The three winners will be awarded 90 days access to the complex computer’s developer platform. The IBM Watson Mobile Developer Challenge invited teams to design mobile apps using Watson's, pictured, cognitive computing capabilities. The 25 finalists will now submit prototypes for judging, after which only five teams will present proposals to IBM. Three winners will get access to the Watson's developer platform . The IBM Watson Mobile Developer Challenge was launched at this year’s Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. It invited teams to design mobile apps using Watson’s cognitive computing capabilities to ‘analyse, discover insights and learn from Big Data’. The 25 finalists will now submit prototypes for judging, after which only five teams will present proposals to IBM. The three winners will get access to the API as well as consultations from IBM Interactive design services. The finalists are a mix of entertainment, health and innovation. For example, the Azoft team want to build an app ‘for anyone who wants to talk to an interesting and smart person, politician, scientist or celebrity’. Ultramatics: Offers personalised answers to the most important health questions. Voyager Innovations: Lets users shop surely and quickly. Ringful Health: Lets patients have informed conversations with their doctors on healthcare decisions. Majestyk Apps: A cognitive companion that improves education. GenieMD: Lets users take a more active role in managing their health. Red Ant: A sales trainer that lets employees easily identify individual customers’ likely interests. BrightMinded: A virtual personal trainer that follows users through all aspects of their fitness experience. 9W Search: The next-generation approach to the consumption of financial information. Strategia Tecnologia: Helps family farmers get answers to their questions about agriculture. Acute Dynamics: Lets users view, execute and track activities related to their work. CrayonData: Helps consumers simplify choices in every aspect of life. GoGoHealth: Lets doctors diagnose and treat patients remotely, using evidence-based protocols. Kutir: Lets hiring managers and recruiters identify potential hires and alerts candidates to openings. InXero: Lets reseller businesses more efficiently reach customers on their offerings. Instancy: A revolutionary personal learning guide. Azoft: Lets users connect with any interesting and smart person, politician, scientist or celebrity. Rumble: Newspaper and magazine apps with the highest level of user experience and personalization. Inteliwise: A user-friendly AI-powered app that connects citizens and local city councils. Biovideo: Puts the most helpful information for new and expectant mothers at their fingertips. Activepackets: A personalized automobile research app. Unified . Computer Intelligence Corp: Lets users quickly order fresh ingredients . from best-priced sources for delivery within hours. Flexport: Makes international trade more accessible and affordable. Ontodia: Concierge service lets users ask detailed questions about local government and private resources. Sense.ly/MyIdealDoctor: Lets individuals and doctors quickly access information for unmatched healthcare. Xoriant: Lets rural customers access microfinance organization and related data on the go. They propose that Watson will be able to find answers to questions asked to a users’ idol that are found in public access pages, publications, interviews and books, but which are not easy to find through standard search engines. Earlier this year Watson became a call centre worker. This graphic explains how the scheme worked . The team said: ‘Because we can focus Watson on particular sets of source materials to prepare answers and make Watson learn, it will produce an ultimate product that gives everyone a gift of real-life communication through Q&A with someone they’d only dreamt of talking to.’ ‘Users can immediately ask questions or initiate conversations with people of their interest as in a regular instant-message service. ‘At later stages, we can implement speech recognition and text-to-speech ability. Meanwhile, the Biovideo App has been designed to ‘provide the best help for new and expectant mothers at their fingertips.’ It uses the Baby 101 searchable database and plans to make the service available to all – it is currently limited by location. ‘Providing the power of Watson to the Baby 101 program provides unlimited information, insight and reach to new parents,’ explained the proposal. ‘A mother with a sick child can ask Dr. Watson what’s wrong with her baby and get a 100 per cent accurate response from data Watson has pulled from trusted sources on the internet, including scientific journals.’ Elsewhere, the GoGoHealth app would let doctors and specialists diagnose and treat patients remotely. Patients would log into their provider app, and the app makes a call to the Electronic Health Record system the doctor is using, pulls all history data, and asks the patients to specify their symptoms. In 2011 IBM's Watson computer competed against Jeopardy's two most successful contestants, Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter. During the practice match Watson was given the same questions as the other contestants and could virtually press the buzzer to answer. In the majority of cases Watson beat both contestants . Based on the symptoms and history, the app would ask each patient questions to accurately assess the condition. There are also fitness apps among the finalists, such as Brightminded. According to the team behind the plans: ‘Watson can be the perfect fitness trainer, and to achieve that it needs to be with users during all aspects of their fitness journey: when they are at the gym, at the track or at the supplements shop. ‘We want to use Watson’s cognitive abilities to learn from users’ daily data - gathered from manual entry and wearable sensor technology, latest medical research and available online fitness expertise to determine what works for a user’s metabolism, physical structure, fat distribution, and hormonal profile.’ They said the Watson-powered app could change its recommendation as training progresses, or goals change. It could also recommend the best supplement products based on reviews and requirements, for example if the user is allergic to dairy."

         "Stephen Hawking recently said that the development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race. Now, Google chief executive, Eric Schmidt has weighed into the discussion, arguing that there is no need to fear AI, and it could even be the making of humanity. 'These concerns are normal,' he said onstage during the Financial Times Innovate America event in New York this week. 'They're also to some degree misguided.' Google chief executive, Eric Schmidt, says there is no need to fear AI, and it could be the making of humanity . The Google chief, who is involved in the development of AI in applications such as self-driving cars, also says that the fear of robots stealing human jobs is unwarranted. 'There's lots of evidence that when computers show up, wages go up,' he said, according to a report by Issie Lapowsky in Wired. 'There's lots of evidence that people who work with computers are paid more than people without.' He argues that machines are far more simplistic that people believe. He used the example of an experiment Google conducted a few years ago on a computer 'neural network'. The Google chief, who is involved in the development of AI in applications such as self-driving cars (pictured), also says that the fear of robots stealing human jobs is unwarranted . Eric Schmidt's comments (right) following a warning by Professor Stephen Hawking (left) that humanity faces an uncertain future as technology learns to think for itself and adapt to its environment . During the test, company's scientists used and artificial neural network and inputted 11,000 hours of YouTube videos to see what it could learn, without any training. 'It discovered the concept of \"cat\",' Schmidt said. 'I'm not quite sure what to say about that, except that that's where we are.' With Google at the forefront of AI development, Eric Schmidt has a lot to gain from public acceptance of the technology. Our desire to create helpful digital assistants and self-driving vehicles could bring about our demise. Professor Stephen Hawking has again warned that humanity faces an uncertain future as technology learns to think for itself and adapt to its environment. Speaking at event in London, the physicist told the BBC that: 'The development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race.' This echoes claims he made earlier in the year when he said success in creating AI 'would be the biggest event in human history,  unfortunately, it might also be the last.' He argues that developments in digital personal assistants Siri, Google Now and Cortana are merely symptoms of an IT arms race which 'pale against what the coming decades will bring.' But Professor Hawking noted that other potential benefits of this technology could also be significant, with the potential to eradicate, war, disease and poverty. 'Looking further ahead, there are no fundamental limits to what can be achieved,' continued Professor Hawking. 'There is no physical law precluding particles from being organised in ways that perform even more advanced computations than the arrangements of particles in human brains.' Google's DeepMind start-up, which was bought for £255 million ($400 million) earlier this year, is currently attempting to mimic the properties of the human brain's short-term working memory. By combining the way ordinary computers work with the way the human brain works, the artificial intelligence researchers hope the machine will learn to program itself. Described as a 'Neural Turing Machine', it learns as it stores memories, and later retrieve them to perform logical tasks beyond those it has been trained to do. The acquisition of DeepMind followed Google's recent purchase of seven robotics firms, including Meka, which makes humanoid robots, and Industrial Perception, which specialises in machines that can package goods, for example. In August, Google also revealed it had teamed up with two of Oxford University's artificial intelligence teams to help machines better understand users. 'It is a really exciting time for AI research these days, and progress is being made on many fronts including image recognition and natural language understanding,' wrote Demis Hassabis, co-founder of DeepMind and vice president of engineering at Google in a blog post. But despite these projects, and Schmidt's comments, Google is also aware of the dangers involved with AI and machine learning. So much so that in January it set up an ethics board to oversee its work in these fields. In fact, one of the original founders of Google's DeepMind warned artificial intelligence is the 'number 1 risk for this century,' and believes it could play a part in human extinction. 'Eventually, I think human extinction will probably occur, and technology will likely play a part in this,' DeepMind's Shane Legg said in an interview earlier this year. The ethics board, revealed by web site The Information, is to ensure the projects are not abused. Earlier this year, Elon Musk likened artificial intelligence to 'summoning the demon'. The Tesla and Space X founder previously warned that the technology could someday be more harmful than nuclear weapons.

         "By . Sarah Griffiths . Drones that can choose to deviate from a set mission and hunt in ‘swarms’ could be patrolling skies within the next 25 years, according to a new roadmap. Unmanned aircraft carrying stronger chemical weapons could also be on the horizon, the U.S. Department of Defence (DoD) revealed in its Unmanned Systems Integrated Roadmap. While the document sets out plans for unmanned maritime, land and air vehicles, there is a lot of focus on the future capability of controversial drones, which, if the plans come to fruition, could deviate from mission commands set by humans if they spot a better target. The U.S. Department of Defence (DoD) revealed its Unmanned Systems Integrated Roadmap, which includes plans for drones that can swarm, deviate from a set mission and carry stronger chemical weapons. A current MQ-9 Reaper drone used in Afghanistan is pictured . Current drones require intensive manpower on the ground to fly, which is expensive and the DoD plans on cutting costs by letting the machines make more decisions themselves, Live Science reported. At the moment drones follow precise commands to complete a predetermined step-by-step mission, but the unmanned aircraft of the future could deviate from tasks, informed by ‘laws’ that govern their behaviour, laid out in algorithms and machine learning, as well as advanced sensors. While drones, or unmanned aircraft, currently use GPS to navigate war zones and remote areas, the satellite signals used by the systems can be jammed easily, so the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is working on jam-proof ‘inertial guidance systems’. Current drones require intensive manpower on the ground, which is expensive and the DoD plans on cutting costs by letting the machines make more decisions themselves. A demonstrator model of Neuron, a pan-European stealth combat drone is pictured . The DoD's roadmap also features plans for deadly ‘swarms’ of drone-bombs that are launched from an unmanned ‘mothership’ to circle the skies while a human operator searches for targets for the drones to crash into, guided by the bots’ on-bard cameras. Thanks to the unmanned mothership, the kamikaze drones could have a range of over 250 nautical miles (463km) the roadmap said. The weapons dropped by more traditional drones are also set to get more deadly under the plans, as researchers are working on ‘energetic nanoparticles’ with a larger surface areas so that the chemicals within the ammunition reach faster and create a more powerful explosion. The technologies combined are intended to help the U.S. military be ‘more effective through greater automation and greater performance,’ the report says. designer Ruben Pater's Drone Survival guide has been likened to 21st century bird watching . A Dutch designer has penned the Drone Survival Guide, which like bird watching charts, shows the various shapes and sizes of flying objects by their silhouettes. Ruben Pater’s guide, however, details the differing kinds of flying robots used at war, as well as survival tips of how to hide from them. The majority of the drones selected for the chart are from NATO member countries, including the UK, France, Germany, U.S. and Canada. This is because these countries have used drones in wars such as Afghanistan and are also more transparent than some other countries in disclosing information about the robots, such as their wingspan. It uses a skull icon to show that a drone is used for attack and a little eye to denote a surveillance vehicle. The chart, which Mr Pater describes as ‘21st century bird watching’ shows the vast array of flying war machines used today from the giant 130ft wingspan of the Global Hawk drone to the petite Parrot AC quadcopter, which measures just 23 inches. He said: ‘Most drones are used today by military powers for remote-controlled surveillance and attack and their numbers are growing. 'The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) predicted in 2012 that within 20 years there could be as many as 30.000 drones flying over U.S. soil alone. ‘As robotic birds will become commonplace in the near future, we should be prepared to identify them. This survival guide is an attempt to familiarise ourselves and future generations, with a changing technological environment.’"

         "#HotJesus",
         "Clearly Jesus was sexy. After all, He is the Son of God. I don't mean to be disrespectful, but as I watched the trailer for the new movie, \"Son of God,\" I found myself gawking at the actor portraying Jesus. Diogo Morgado is one hot dude. His Jesus looks more like Brad Pitt than that nice man with the beard in all those paintings. I'm not the only one gawking at Morgodo's Jesus. He inspired the hashtag, \"#HotJesus\". It went viral on Twitter. The actor told The New York Times he doesn't want his looks to distract from the movie, but, \"If the message of Jesus was love, hope and compassion, and I can bring that to more people by being a more appealing Jesus, I am happy with that.\" Clearly we have a new trend. A \"more appealing\" Jesus is not just a better prophet, he's ... sexy. We actually don't know what Jesus looked like. We do know he was a carpenter, so perhaps Jesus was buff. But, I don't think when the Biblical Nathaniel asked, \"Nazareth! Can anything good come from there?\" and Phillip answered, \"Come and see,\" they were talking about Jesus' beautiful face or chiseled abs. Yes, Jesus, as portrayed in countless paintings, has a six-pack. As comedian and author, Greg Behrendt joked, \"I'd like to get ripped ... ripped like Jesus. Jesus was ripped. You've seen the pictures, right? He's ripped! Ripped. He's the son of God. He's not going to be walking around saying I've got back fat today, I'm so puffy.\" All joking aside, why must Jesus be sexy? Or ripped? Or even handsome? The Rev. Robert B. Lawton, SJ, a Jesuit priest and former president of Loyola Marymount University, says, \"There is absolutely no indication that Jesus was good-looking and sexy. In fact there is a passage in the prophet Isaiah that is taken as referring to Jesus. It says this: . \"He had no form or majesty that we should look at him/nothing in his appearance that we should desire him. He was despised and rejected by others; a man of suffering and acquainted with infirmity; and as one from whom others hide their faces he was despised, and we held him of no account.\" (Isaiah 53. 2-3.) While this might not be conclusive evidence, it's quite possible that Jesus was no Jewish Brad Pitt from Palestine. On the other hand, why wouldn't God create a perfect Son? \"Anything that is sexy is going to attract people. People who might not go to the movie might want to check it out, particularly non-Christians,\" says the Rev. Lisa Jenkins, senior pastor of St. Matthew's Baptist Church in Harlem. \"I don't see a problem with Jesus being attractive given our cultural context,\" she says. \"I don't recall a Jesus who was not appealing to the eye. That's Hollywood.\" Jenkins is more concerned about what she considers an inaccurate portrayal of Jesus' ethnicity. The Rev. James Martin, SJ, editor-at-large for America Magazine, and author of the coming book, \"Jesus: A Pilgrimage,\" agrees. \"God did not choose to incarnate himself in Laguna Beach,\" he says. \"He chose to incarnate Himself at a certain place, at a certain time in a certain person.\" And that person was a Palestinian Jew. \"Many people have a hard time with the humanity of Jesus ... the closer He is to human physical perfection, the easier it is for some to accept Him.\" But, Martin says, there is a danger in that too. A physically perfect Jesus makes Him into a God pretending to be man. When Jesus was both human and divine. \"He was like us in all things, except sin, as the theology goes,\" Martin says. \"That means, He had a body, He got sick, He got tired, He may have sprained an ankle or two. There are passages in the Gospel showing Him falling asleep because He was tired. We tend to airbrush the physical imperfections away.\" Those traits make Jesus so much more accessible. So much more ... human. I tried to come up with a living person to compare to Jesus. That, of course, is impossible. The closest I can come, as a Catholic, is Pope Francis. I've grown to revere him. Is it because he's sexy? In a word: No."

         "By . Damien Gayle . PUBLISHED: . 12:37 EST, 1 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 12:55 EST, 5 February 2013 . Rumours are circulating that Sony is preparing to launch its next generation games console soon after the Japanese tech giant sent out invitations to an event on 'the future of PlayStation.' Sony would not say whether it was preparing to unveil the successor to the 70million selling PS3 at the February 20 meeting in New York, but the prospect had gamers abuzz on Twitter. 'We will be talking about the PlayStation business,' Sony spokesman Masaki Tsukakoshi said today. Tantalising: A still from the video Sony released to drum up excitement over its PlayStation announcement . Despite that, the scale of the excitement over the meeting was indicated by a Google search for 'Sony Feb 20 PlayStation' which returned more than 7million hits. The last time Sony held a PlayStation event, in January 2011, it presented a protoype of its handheld Vita console. Before that, it convened a gathering in 2005 two months after it first demonstrated the PS3 concept. A meeting in 1999 revealed designs for the PS2. It has been more than six years since Sony launched the PS3 home console, a longer gap than between it and its PS2 predecessor, adding to the anticipation that it will soon disclose its next gaming concept. Current generation: Sony's super-slim . PlayStation 3 has been on the market for more than six years, selling some 70million units, making the . Japanese technology firm long overdue a new flagship product launch . Despite remaining tight-lipped about the specific purpose of the press conference, the company published a teaser video about the meeting on YouTube which has already been viewed more than 400,000 times in less than 24 hours. The video also promoted a Twitter hashtag, #Playstation2013, to which video game fans flocked to share their excitement about the forthcoming event. It was clear that most expected to see the PS4 unveiled. '#playstation2013 I am ready for next gen consoles !!!' wrote Dogukan Celik on the social messaging site. David Brammell Jr tweeted: 'I may not be ready for a new console yet. I might be getting one sooner that I think. Mystery Sony conference in Feb. #playstation2013 #PS4.' Such a console would follow Nintendo's Wii U, which launched last autumn, and precede Microsoft's next Xbox game console, which will likely be unveiled in June at the E3 video game conference in Los Angeles. The PlayStation Vita: The portable console, successor to the PSP, was unveiled the last time Sony held a PlayStation event, in January 2011 . Since Sony's last home console launch, the games market has been transformed by the boom in smartphones and tablet computers that have wooed players with free or cheap games. Sony and its video game rivals Nintendo and Microsoft now have to contend with competition from powerful hand-held devices made by Apple, Samsung and a string of others. Analysts expect that tablets and other mobile devices will match the power and graphics of today's games consoles within a few years. Many are already able to run the kinds of 3D games that were once the exclusive preserve of those dedicated machines and high-spec gaming PCs. Struggling under competitive pressure, Nintendo on Wednesday cut its sales target for the Wii U, successor to its 100million-selling Wii, to 4million machines by the end of March from its launch in November. That compared with an earlier forecast for 5.5million."

         "The accusations against the Revlon CEO are ugly -- but that doesn't mean Twitter can't pretty them up with some humor. According to the New York Post, the cosmetics company's CEO, Lorenzo Delpani, is being sued by a former company scientist, Alan Meyers, who is alleging discrimination. Meyers says in the suit that the Italian-born Delpani expressed disdain for such groups as Jews, blacks and Americans as a whole. According to the suit, Delpani said he could \"smell a black person when he entered a room,\" noted that \"Jews stick together\" and said Americans were \"small-minded\" and \"dirty.\" A Revlon representative told the Post that the suit was a product of an unhappy ex-employee. Meyers was let go because he \"repeatedly demonstrated critical lapses in judgment and failed to perform at the high standard we demand of our employees,\" she said. Revlon Chairman Ronald O. Perelman said in a statement, \"I know Lorenzo as an executive and as a person. ... He is among the least bigoted or biased human I have ever known. He has my full support.\" Nevertheless, the kerfuffle hasn't stopped wags on Twitter from making the hashtag #ShadesofRevlon trend, whether out of outrage or comic potential. \"Don't forget #ShadesOfRevlon's fragrance line: Dirty Americans perfume, Black Room cologne, & Yiddish Smell of Success.

         "Ready for battle: Model Sara McKenna is fighting with Olympic skier Bode Miller, who wants joint custody of McKenna's newborn son . Ski champion Bode Miller's ex-lover - who gave birth to his child last month - has made an appeal not to grant custody of the newborn in the latest drama to come out of a months-long custody fight. Model Sara McKenna claimed in a court filing this week that the famed Olympic skier should not have custody of her son because he lives on a yacht and has substance abuse problems. It's a new twist in an ugly saga between Miller, McKenna and Miller's wife, volleyball player Morgan Beck, whom Miller married late last year. TMZ, which first reported news of the . legal documents, reported that McKenna also claimed Miller did not want . the child, and ask her to have an abortion. Miller, 35, launched his fight for . joint legal and physical custody of McKenna's child just days after Beck . suffered a miscarriage in January. Miller did not return a call from TMZ for comment. Last week, McKenna filed a police report against Beck, claiming online attacks and threatening messages on Twitter. McKenna claims that she was sent a series of online posts from Beck under different accounts that threatened her and insulted her with words like 'c***' and 'bitch.' TMZ reported that the NYPD is taking McKenna's filing seriously, and is investigating. At the time of Miller's custody request, McKenna . told TMZ: 'I will be fighting this in court and will not give up . my son to somebody who did not want him to begin with.' Loss: Bode Miller, with wife and volleyball star Morgan Beck. The couple had a miscarriage in January .

         "By . Meghan Keneally . PUBLISHED: . 15:16 EST, 2 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 15:47 EST, 2 May 2013 . The trail of photos left online by the friends of the Boston Marathon bomber shows that they went on a trip from Massachusetts to New York City in recent months. There is an eerie shadow over the photos as it was revealed that suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and his now-dead brother Tamerlan were plotting to continue their terror streak in Manhattan after killing three and injuring more than 200 in the marathon bombing. Dias Kadyrbayev and Azamat Tazhayakov, both Kazakh nationals, and an American friend Robel Phillipos were all arrest on Wednesday for various charges relating to helping their friend 'Jahar' cover up his tracks after the bombing. Blocks away: Azamat Tazhayakov posted this picture of himself in front of The New York Times headquarters, just blocks from Times Square, on his profile for a Russian social media site . Seeing the sights: Tazhayakov is seen posing in front of the Statue of Liberty with two unidentified friends during the same trip to New York . Boys trip: Azamat Tazhayakov (left) and Dias Kadyrbayev (center) pose with suspected bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev (right) in the middle of Times Square in Manhattan during a trip thought to have taken place in April 2012 . Kadyrbayev, 19, and Tazhayakov, 20, have profiles on Russian social media site VKontakte that show pictures of themselves touring Manhattan, though it does not appear that Phillipos was on the trip. At one point during the trip, which appears to have taken place in April 2012, the group stopped to take the typical tourist shot in front of the Statue of Liberty. Another stop on their tour was Times Square, where five young men- including Tsarnaev, Kadyrbayev and Tazhayakov- posed happily. Different view: Because the charges against the friends, including Tazhayakov on the left, focus on their involvement after the bombings, it does not imply that they had any prior knowledge about the attack- or the Tsarnaev's plot to drive down to Manhattan on the same day and continue their attack . No red flags: Tazahayakov's social media profile does not seem unlike that of many other college-age boys . Tazhayakov also had his picture taken outside of the office of The New York Times, just blocks away from Times Square. The bustling New York tourist attraction clearly stuck with Tsarnaev, as he and his brother reportedly considered it as a second bombing location. Following Tamerlan's death during an altercation with police and Dzhokar's arrest, the FBI reported that the pair initially planned on driving the BMW that they hijacked and driving it to New York from Boston but were thwarted by a lack of gas. Enjoying life: Azamat Tazhayakov posted pictures of himself smoking a hookah pipe (left) and relaxing . Pals: Kadyrbayev (center) and Tazhayakov (right) lived together in an apartment off of the UMASS-Dartmouth campus in New Bedford, though it is unclear where this picture was taken . Connection: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is seen here with Dias Kadyrbayev, and the two reportedly joked about him being the Boston Marathon bomber via text in the days after the attack . Joking: Kadyrbayev, seen with two different friends, told investigators that he thought Tsarnaev was playing around when he sent texts brushing off similarities between himself and the suspected bomber . 'Questioning of Dzhokhar revealed that he and his brother decided spontaneously on Times Square as a target,' New York police commissioner Ray Kelly said a news conference with New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg. 'They would drive to Times Square that same night. That plan, however, fell apart when they realized that the vehicle that they hijacked was low on gas and ordered the driver to stop at a nearby gas station.' Apparently the city left an impression on Tazhayakov as well, as he highlights their group trip. In addition to pictures from their trip, Tazhayakov posts about songs that he likes- including Green Day's 'When September Ends' and more recently Macklemore and Ryan Lewis' 'Can Not Hold Us', which he added on April 18, just days after the bombing. Waiting: Dias Kadyrbayev (pictured) is now being held without bail until the May 14 hearing, along with his friends Tazhayakov and Phillipos . Flashy: Kadyrbayev's affinity for nice cars prompted the investigation as he was first questioned by police about his 'humorous' vanity license plates that read 'TERRORISTA#1' Red flag: Police initially investigated the pair after the discovery of their license plates (pictured) but then held them on immigration charges since they are Kazakh nationals in the country on expired academic visas . On his profile, fellow arrestee Dias Kadyrbayev posted the Times Square group shot, along with another undated picture of himself with Tsarnaev and other friends. Kadyrbayev also features pictures of himself on a sunny beach, goofing around with a friend while climing in a tree, and posing in a luxury car. Kadyrbayev's affinity for flashy cars is what got them into trouble in the first place with police, as they were initially questioned when it was revealed that the BMW that had a vanity license plate that read 'TERRORISTA#1'. His lawyer argued that the plate was a gag gift, police became suspicious and then held both he and Tazhayakov in custody because of immigration issues, as their student visas had expired. On Wednesday, they both were charged with conspiring to obstruct justice by destroying evidence. The criminal complaint lists that they removed Dzhokhar's backpack from his room and 'agreed to get rid of it after concluding from news reports that Tsarnaev was one of the Boston Marathon bombers.' Girlfriend: Though a girl who had a brief romantic relationship with Tsarnaev has come forward, the girl in this picture seen being kissed by Kadyrbayev has not been identified . Mystery woman: The girl seen with Tazhayakov in this picture has not been identified either . The three friends- Kadyrbayev, Tazhayakov and Phillipos- went over to Tsarnaev's on-campus dormitory after seeing the news reports. When the group arrived at the dorm, Kadyrbayev showed Tazhayakov a text from the bomber that said 'I'm about to leave if you need something in my room take it.' He did not specify where he was going, but Tazhayakov told investigators that he felt that this meant he would never see Tsarnaev alive again. They were let in the room by Dzhokhar's roommate, who said that Dzhokhar had been there just a few hours earlier. The criminal complaint says that when there, the three friends watched a movie. Kadyrbayev 'knew' that Tsarnaev was involved in the fatal attack when he saw the empty fireworks in the dorm room."

         "(CNN) -- The Gettysburg Address was a quick-hitting speech that was built to last. Length: A little over two minutes. Message: Stay the course of a difficult war. If Democracy won't work here, it won't work anywhere. Short enough to comfortably fit into a social media status box, and shared in its entirety hundreds of times every day, according to recent data from Facebook. Memorable phrases are quoted even more often. It has been 150 years since President Abraham Lincoln got up in front of thousands of people in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, to dedicate the Soldiers' National Cemetery at a turning point in the Civil War. His words are some of the most memorable in American history, forever stamping our collective minds with \"four score and seven years ago,\" and \"all men are created equal,\" and of course a \"government of the people, by the people, for the people.\" Some of this wasn't really his coinage, but we'll get into that later. Politicians portrayed themselves differently in Lincoln's day, seeking to give a more powerful kind of impression, said Dennis Baron, a professor of English and linguistics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. \"If you did that today, people would think of you as somehow flowery and old-fashioned and ... why are you doing that?\" The modern trend is for leaders to \"play the folksy card,\" Baron said, portraying themselves as ordinary Joes and Janes who are exactly like you in every way -- except for the fact that they are hoping to achieve a position of immense power. Baron said the last president with an \"oratorial\" style -- on the whole -- was probably John F. Kennedy, who was assassinated 100 years and three days after the delivery of the Gettysburg Address. We still remember Kennedy's delivery of lines like, \"Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country.\" Lincoln was able to get straight to the point and deliver a punchy speech in part because he came after Edward Everett's marathon presentation about the war, explains James Cornelius, curator of the Lincoln Collection in the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum. Lincoln had no speechwriter. Today, most politicians have at least some help preparing their words. Everett had been the main attraction, but Lincoln's speech started picking up steam afterward and seemed to \"go viral\" in the manner of its day. Newspapers wrote about the speech. In some cities, people could buy commemorative event pamphlets that contained the speech, and key phrases were incorporated into Lincoln's 1864 election posters and memorials after his death. Newspaper retracts editorial panning Gettysburg Address . Sound familiar? Cornelius said overall, Civil War-era America was a consumer-driven society that had a few things in common with our Internet-saturated world. One can only imagine the tweets that would have been written about such a speech in modern times. \"OMG. Lincoln just said in two minutes what Everett tried to say in two hours. #NailedIt #Boom\" Today, children learn the address in school, especially in Northern cities, and documentary guru Ken Burns is asking people to record themselves saying the speech from memory. Ken Burns: Learn the Gettysburg Address by heart . People also share the quotations on social media. Certain phrases seem to stick out, and Facebook numbers show which ones we like to share. We found that people in some states, like Delaware, were particularly fond of quoting the address and that different parts of the speech were more popular in some states than others. Here is a nonexhaustive rundown of some of the most popular phrases in the speech, in order of appearance. 'Four score and seven years ago' Pretty much everyone knows this part of the Gettysburg Address, even if they think a score is just something from sports. But no, in this case a score is 20 of something. Here, a span of 20 years. This line is a bit of an inside remark shared with the audience, believed by most historians to be a reference to Psalm 90:10, which most people of the day would know is an allusion to the human lifespan. \"The days of our years are threescore years and 10,\" says the psalm. \"And if by reason of strength they be fourscore years, yet is their strength labor and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we fly away.\" Cornelius said Lincoln used such phrasing as a subtle reminder that the nation was only a youthful 87 years old. Lincoln felt the United States was setting an example for the world, and he didn't want the experiment in democracy to fail. \"He's a little bit worried that the nation might die at about the average lifespan that a human would,\" Cornelius said. \"He's putting forth straightforward political terms in a poetic way.\" That, and people tend to remember the beginnings of speeches, Cornelius said. 'All men are created equal' More clever wordplay is at work in this famous quotation. \"In his call for democracy and equality, (Lincoln) doesn't mention slavery, but everyone knew that was what he was talking about,\" Cornelius said. See what he did there? This phrase can be interpreted as both an allusion to the principles of the Declaration of Independence and also as a not-so-subtle jab at the institution of slavery. Little doubt exists that Lincoln opposed slavery, and in fact loathed it, Cornelius said. Slavery was at the heart of the war. Lincoln struggled with how to go about eliminating it, and had to be convinced by legal thinkers and abolitionists that he had the governmental power to tackle it. 'These dead shall not have died in vain' Something about this part of the speech may be touching a nerve somewhere. This part was the second-most-mentioned phrase in the entire speech, rivaling \"four score and seven years ago\" in popularity, despite the fact that it's not a particularly well-known part of the Gettysburg Address. But Lincoln can't take full credit for this phrase, Cornelius said, because it was a fairly common expression used in the parlance of war. It speaks to a need for soldiers' deaths to mean something, if they must occur -- a timeless desire we echo today. How tech preserves the Gettysburg Address . \"This is always a problem in warfare. Why should any other people die? There is always a percentage of the population that will make that argument at a certain point. Lincoln's contrary point was that they died defending you. They felt so strongly about the right of the cause. They felt so strongly about preserving the union and ending slavery that you should not let their efforts carry into the wind. You should continue on and further this effort.\" 'This nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom' This phrase was mentioned by many readers who commented on this story. For some, it has become a point of political contention due to the presence of the words \"under God.\" There are five versions of the speech, and one of them omits those two words. Obama stands out from the Gettysburg crowd . Another slightly earlier portion of the speech was also frequently cited: \"It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us.\" The takeaway there is persistence in the face of adversity. 'Government of the people, by the people, for the people' This famous phrase, as well as the few words immediately before and after it, got lots of mentions on Facebook. Baron pointed out that anything at the end or beginning of a speech is probably automatically more memorable. It doesn't hurt if a speech is structured to enhance this effect, either. It's such a beloved word grouping that numerous people have borrowed it, massaged it and restated it with a slightly different twist, like a game of telephone in an era without telephones. Cornelius said historians trace this part back to Daniel Webster, a senator and U.S. secretary of state before the Civil War. Webster's words were, \"The people's government, made for the people, made by the people and answerable to the people.\" It was later repurposed by the abolitionist minister Theodore Parker, who talked about a \"government of all the people, by all the people, for all the people.\" Even Lincoln himself is said to have used a version of the phrase in a letter 20 years before the address, Cornelius said. Cornelius said the key to the power of this phrase is in its skillful use of repetition. The point of \"people\" is driven straight into your mind by its frequent mention. That's why so many people have recycled it over the years. Fast-forward to today, and we're still sharing all the phrases above. Cornelius said one can see the endurance of Lincoln's speaking legacy by taking a stroll into the Lincoln library's gift shop, where you can pick up your very own T-shirt with a Lincoln quotation on it. One recently released item has the whole text printed on it. Lincoln's speech endures like few others, especially in our everyman-politician era. Maybe that's why people can't help but post the speech on social media, 150 years after the fact. Why do you think the Gettysburg Address endures today, and why do some lines seem to resonate more with different places and groups in the United States? Share your thoughts in the comments below."

         "(CNN) -- Washington was a sea of smartphones snapping photos on Monday throughout the pomp and circumstance of Inauguration Day. Between the glamorous gowns, the presidential oath, and the parade of marching bands, it was a day meant to be documented. But we made a discovery during it all: Just as interesting as the photos themselves were the people taking them. Back in 2009, the inauguration was a huge deal -- an estimated 1.8 million people packed the National Mall to see America's first African-American president make history. Not surprisingly, CNN iReport saw a record number of contributions that day: nearly 12,000 submissions of \"the moment,\" when President Obama took the oath of office. This time, things were different. There were fewer attendees -- officials estimated between 800,000 to 900,000 people attended Monday's inauguration. But, more importantly, the social media landscape has dramatically changed in the past four years. So this time around, we invited our audience to document the inauguration through Instagram, the mobile photo-sharing site that was launched in October 2010 and now boasts an impressive 90 million monthly active users. The call to action was simple -- we invited attendees to take an Instagram shot of themselves during the inaugural festivities, tag the photo #cnn, and share why they made the trek to Washington -- and the end result was fantastic. Between Sunday and Monday, we received more than 10,300 photos and showcased some of the best submissions in a custom interactive. Others uploaded photos to iReport, CNN's global participatory news community. Together, the photos tell you a story about the people assembled for Obama's second inauguration. The crowd was diverse, made up of people old and young, black and white. There were families and groups of friends. For some, it was their first inauguration. Others were back to see Obama's inaugural speech a second time. It was cold and sunny, as evidenced by the number of winter hats and sunglasses in the crowd. At least one attendee, though, used her shades to block more than just the sunshine. \"I was a total crybaby out there,\" she wrote. American flags were the other accessory du jour. \"Don't even think about going without a flag,\" advised iReporter Lisa Clemans-Cope, mother of two young girls. At least one attendee made a point to stand out among the rest -- in a clever homemade \"Obama Care Bear\" costume. There were notable attendees in the crowd -- \"Glee's\" Darren Criss, Rep. Grace Meng, D-New York, and comedian Hal Sparks all joined the Instagram + iReport project -- alongside average citizens. And most everyone was grinning ear to ear, except for one man who documented his frustration with the glitchy Mall television feed. Finally, there were the stories behind the photos. Renee Chrisman shared a photo of her husband, Gunnery Sgt. Bradley Chrisman, who was chosen to escort inaugural VIPs onto the stage. Renee and their children were glued to the television set at home in North Carolina hoping to see Bradley in action. \"We caught a glimpse of him standing to the right of the president,\" she gushed. Political science student John White took notes during the ceremony. \"I plan on pursuing a career in national politics,\" he said. \"Now that I am beginning to lay out the work for my future career, this inauguration is my first step.\" And for Becky Primeaux, attending the inauguration meant she could cross off an item on her \"bucket list.\" \"To be part of something that is so patriotic and historic is so exciting,\" she said. \"I think every American should (attend an inauguration) in their life.\""

         "A Pennsylvania high school senior student was suspended Thursday when he asked Miss America, Nina Davuluri, out to the prom when she made an appearance at the school. Davuluri was at Central York High School in York, just south of the state capital, Harrisburg, Thursday when Patrick Farves, 18, asked Miss America to prom during a question and answer session. Farves said he received three days of in-school suspension he asking the reigning Miss America out to the prom. Scroll down for video . Miss America, Nina Davuluri, was at a high school in York, Pennsylvania when she got asked to the prom by a senior, who was then suspended for three days for asking her the question . Although he was warned not to by a staff member, Patrick Farves, 18, asked Miss America out to the prom during an appearance she made at the school, earning Farves a three-day suspension. 'They (administrators) did that because they told me not to but I did it anyway,\" Farves responded on Twitter to a question from areporter. 'They did what they had to.' Davuluri was at the school Thursday to talk with students about diversity and the importance of science, technology, engineering and mathematics. She also gave keynote speech at the school's annual diversity celebration. It wasn't a spur of the moment decision for Farves. He had joked with friends about doing it when he heard Miss America was coming to the school, according to the York Dispatch. And as the day got closer, he was asked increasingly if he was going to go through with it. School administrators caught wind of Farves' plan, and one staff member pulled him aside before the assembly and told him it would be inappropriate to ask Davuluri out. But that didn't stop Farves. 'At that point in time, it was 10 minutes before the presentation, and I was pretty much set to do it,' he said. 'I was a little pressured. Everybody expected me to do it. I'm the kind of person who, if someone says I won't do something, I'll prove people wrong. I will.' Nina Davuluri, representing New York, reacts after being crowned Miss America on September 15, 2013 in Atlantic City, New Jersey . The school, facing criticism from some who thought the administration went to far, responded on Friday afternoon. 'It is not our practice to discipline a student for asking someone — even Miss America — to a school dance,' the statement from the Central York School District reads in part. 'However, it is our practice to set expectations for student behavior, to communicate those expectations and rules to students and families and to ensure those rules are followed within our schools. This practice is not uncommon and happens every day, multiple times a day, in schools, businesses and homes across America.' The school district also took offense to the media's reporting of the incident, saying, 'it's as shame that the media wants to frame this story to sell papers and make headlines using a distortion of what actually occurred.' Many students, however, think the administration overreacted, and took to social media to express their feeling, using the hashtag #freepatty on Twitter. 'True diversity is when you don't punish someone for being a little bit different\" @CYStudentUnion tweeted."

         "For many people, picking foundation or fake eyelashes can be an overwhelming and time consuming task, making buying the right beauty products more difficult than it should be. Australia's top beauty experts have come to the rescue to make the process a whole lot easier, doing the research to find the products that will make you look- and feel- amazing. The winners for 2014 have been revealed by beautyheaven.com.au, listing the very best hair, makeup and skincare products on the market. Scroll down to see the Best in Beauty Awards of 2014 . Winners of the Best in Beauty awards 2014 have been announced by leading Australian beauty website beautyheaven.com.au . Senior content producer of beautyheaven, Olivia Mackinnon, told Daily Mail Australia that the winning products were must-have essentials for any busy woman. Senior content producer of beautyheaven Olivia Mackinnon told Daily Mail Australia why some of the winning products were favoured. Best Hair Treatment - Moroccanoil Original Treatment . ‘I’m a big fan of the Moroccanoil Original Treatment because it’s the best treatment for hair,’ she said. 'It’s great to use as a damp in conditioner when you’re out of the shower to give your hair feeling soft and nourished. ‘It’s easy and versatile to use and you can mix it with other products. I usually mix mine with gel.’ Best Foundation - Estée Lauder Double Wear Stay-In-Place Makeup . ‘The best thing about this foundation is it’s a semi matte liquid foundation for oily skin to give you that hint of radiant and sleek look,’ she said. ‘It controls oil and it’s definitely another one that’s getting a cult status because there’s a huge following behind it. Best Mascara - Benefit They’re Real Mascara . ‘The Benefit They’re Real Mascara is a front runner because it has won the same award from last year,' she said. It’s an innovative mascara that gives that false lash effect and it’s under $40 so people find it reasonable. Best Lipstick - YSL Rouge Pur Couture Lipstick . ‘It has a beautiful gold casing and some of our reviews have said you don’t need to reapply because it lasts long,' she said. ‘We know what works,' said Olivia. 'These products were judged upon what was consistently reliable after gathering a cult status from our beautyheaven members.' beautyheaven members voted over 2000 times for the products they loved, ensuring that the beauty essentials were ones that worked well and were used across a wide range of customers. ‘There was a real mix of winners across all categories where we were able to find the higher end products and brands that have been successful over the year,' she said. ‘The awards are about establishing and rewarding cult products, so it makes sense that some of the winners are those that have made their way into the hands and hearts of consumers and win time and time again,’ she said. ‘It helps men and women across Australia determine the crème-de-la-crème of what is out there, discovering the hidden beauty essentials of others along the way!’ Among the product winners for 2014 were a few familiar brands, holding onto their titles from last year. This was the case for Benefit Hoola as Best Bronzer and ghd eclipse as Best Straightener. ‘The Maybelline tattoo liquid eyeshadow was really popular and won an award two years in a row. It’s different to other eyeshadows because it gives incredible pigment to eyelids,' Olivia said. For the best beauty advice, Olivia said that one of the best tips she had come across was to find a celebrity with similar resemblance to yourself for inspiration. ‘Find a celebrity who has the same skin tone or similar facial features to you,' she said. ‘I look at Leighton Meester and if I see her on the Red Carpet rocking blue eye-liner, I’d feel confident that I could pull that off too. Beauty muse is really helpful.' Pictured from left to right - Lanolips Lip Ointment with Colour, Moroccanoil Original Treatment and Biore Self Heating One Minute Mask . Members had to submit reviews and give products star ratings with an additional secret ballot to reveal the most highly regarded products in each category . ‘Something else I was told a long time ago is to be cautious of what you’re putting in your hair. ‘Don’t overload with hair products because less is more in what I use and these products are designed to last. Too much protein can make it stiff and can’t move in the wind. Olivia said that for all conditioners, especially the three-minute hair treatments, are best left on as long as possible to get the best benefits and allow enough time for nutrients to penetrate the hair. 'You need to leave them on for at least 10 minutes to work because you're basically washing your hair mask down the sink,' she said. 'My advice is to leave it in your hair as long as you can – while you’re vacuuming or running some errands around the house before rinsing.' Australia’s beauty experts have made it their mission to find the best beauty products that’ll make you look and feel amazing . It's not all about the new and improved though, with a few classics remaining a necessity for any beauty-lover. 'Red lipstick will never go out of style. There are so many different shades of red, including pink, coral and orange,' she said. 'I think every girl would suit one of these colours and it makes you look classy and it's the perfect way to lift you up.' Benefit and Garnier swept up the most awards with three products each in the make-up, skincare and hair categories.

         "A Delaware restaurant has come under fire after photographs of bad tippers and their receipts were uploaded to its social networking sites alongside offensive and racist messages. The Padi Restaurant in Hockessin has apologized after images appeared on its manager's Instagram account and the eatery's Facebook page calling people names such as 'cheap' and 'hillbilly'. But the manager, Aaron Kwan, has denied he took the images or wrote the messages - and has instead blamed other employees for accessing his online profiles when he was not looking. After the Wilmington News Journal reported about the messages, the Instagram and Facebook accounts were promptly removed. The News Journal shared several of the offensive messages. In trouble: Offensive and racist messages have appeared on the Instagram account of restaurant manager Aaron Kwan - but he denies that he was the one who posted them . Among them, there was a photo of a bill for $53.80 for a customer with an Indian surname, who had tipped $5.20 - less than 10 per cent. The photo appeared on the Instagram account, fumanchu85, alongside the message: 'What do you expect from a last name like that? #cheap #jew' In a similar message, where a diner with a $45.90 bill paid a $6.10 tip, the person wrote: 'With a last name like that, I don’t think you will ever expect a GOOD tip. #cheap #jerk #indian.' And another image shows a customer paying his bill with the message: '#deuchbag alert. ... hate him and his family. No respect for anyone ever' - before using a derogatory term for the man's wife. Offensive: In one message, a worker posted a picture of a receipt which showed a customer with an Indian surname had left a small tip (top), and then they added an angry message (bottom) He also refered to customers as '#cheapass' and '#hillbillies' in the messages. The News Journal also reported that negative comments were shared on the restaurant's Facebook page, which has now also been removed. 'People need . to take their meds before leaving the comfort of their home,' an October post reads. 'Why would . you come to an Asian restaurant when you don’t feel like having Asian . food.' Kwan, who reportedly would regularly upload pictures of himself to the Instagram account, said he barely used the application and should have checked it more to see if anyone else had access. He added that the messages probably came from other staff members. Rude: Other messages attack diners on the restaurant's public Facebook group for eating takeout there . Site: Many of the messages were posted to the manager's Instagram, pictured, but he says it was hacked . 'It may be hacked because I left my iPad and stuff all around,' he told Delaware Online. 'Probably some other water or waitress got really mad.' Edward B. Rosenthal, an attorney representing the restaurant's owner and Kwan's aunt, Eve Teoh, said the business is working hard to restore its image after the messages emerged two weeks ago. Teoh has written an open letter to customers that hangs beside the counter, apologizing for 'unacceptable and insulting behavior'. 'We . sincerely apologize for those actions, and want the community to know . that those actions and opinions are not consistent with our beliefs and . values, nor are they welcome at our restaurant. Scene: The owner of Padi Restaurant - Kwan's aunt - said they will investigate who is responsible . Inside: Kwan said he thinks other workers accessed his personal profiles when he left his phone out . Damage control: Chef Patrick Wong and owner Eve Teoh have apologized for the offensive messages . 'We want to . assure all of our customers, and members of the community, that those . responsible for insulting our customers and members of the community . will be held accountable, and that we are taking steps to insure that . this type of behavior never happens again,' the letter reads. Rosenthal added that Kwan was on indefinite unpaid leave. 'We're holding him responsible,' he said. 'But we feel there may have been other people .' He added that there will be meetings with staff members to discuss about how they are expected to represent the message of the restaurant on all fronts."

Chubby Checker has filed a £320million lawsuit against Hewlett-Packard over a mobile phone app which bears his name . It was a risque but light-hearted app that claimed to let ladies know what they can expect from a new man based on the size of his feet. But though it promised ‘no need for disappointment or surprise’, someone’s been left thoroughly unamused by the ‘Chubby Checker’ – the singer whose name it borrows.

Lawyers for the singer – whose real name is Ernest Evans – claim the app developed by a company called Magic Apps, has done ‘irreparable damage’ to their client by associating the Checker name with ‘sexual connotation’. They said: 'Purchasers of \"the Chubby Checker\" app and . non-purchasing browsers of the associated web page are being misled into . believing that plaintiffs have endorsed defendant's app.' The suit adds that the app ‘tarnishes’ the stage name which Evans trademarked in 1997.

         "By . Joshua Gardner . A man who spent his vacation giving away $50 and $100 to dozens of need Canadians last week has been tossed into a mental institution. After certain recipients of Richard Wright's rare generosity decided the Prince Edward Island man could be mentally ill, they called authorities Thursday and Wright was hauled away for evaluation. Now his daughter has started an online campaign to get her father out of the institution and claims he's perfectly sane and just wanted to share 'some extra money.' Unfair? Prince Edward Island man Richard Wright was tossed into a psych ward on Thursday not long after dozens of reports emerged that he was giving away hundreds of dollars to dozens of strangers last week . Wants her dad back: Wright's daughter has taken to Facebook to raise awareness of her dad's detainment, which she says is unfair and unnecessary . 'He did nothing illegal, he was simply helping some people out. Since when did being a nice person make you end up in the hospital,' wrote Chelsey Wright on the Facebook page she created, #OpFreeRichardWright.' Richard's troubles began while he was vacationing with family in Halifax. Dozens of people started taking to social media to report a mystery man who gave them $50, $100 and in some cases valuable silver bullion coins simply because he wanted to help them out. Chelsey told Metro News that he saved up for a long time for his charity spree. But that didn't seem to matter after reports came that the modern day Robin Hood spreading the wealth around town may have been mentally ill. 'They think he is sick and has mental . issues,' Chelsey wrote on Sunday. 'I know he does not. He plans to . hopefully attain legal help tomorrow. 'We . are keeping our fingers crossed. My dad is honestly a great guy. He has . always been good to people, and he simply just wanted to help people . out.' Since she created #OpFreeRichardWright, over 3,000 people have joined the group and more are joining all the time. Among his supporters are the people Wright helped along the way, including . Jennifer . Corbett, who received $150 and a promise that 'things will get better' from Wright. She even called him at the psych ward in Charlottetown to . wish him well. 'I don’t . think it’s fair that this happened,' Corbett told Metro. 'I mean do you . think that people are going to want to do good after this?' Authorities won't comment on Wright's case for privacy reasons, but health officials said in a release: . 'A patient is always admitted at the clinical recommendation of a physician who has met with and assessed the patient.' Among the grateful recipients of Wright's kindness were Bill McNamara and June Bond, who received two $50 bills and two valuable silver bullion coins (held by Abigail, 3). Recipients like them have become strong supporters of Wright's ."

Nina Kiwarkis, who is waiting for a heart and lung transplant, was lucky enough to get photographs with both the Duke and the Duchess. Miss Kiwarkis, 52, said: ‘I thought William would say no but he didn’t. He wished me well.’ Scroll down for video .

Delighted: Miss Kiwarkis, 52, from Sydney, also managed to get a selfie with Prince William who wished her well . Oops! The Duchess wasn't quite ready for this selfie with Marian Khamis, who posed with Kate as the royals arrived at Sydney Opera House on Wednesday . Chloe Skafte, a 19-year-old student, took a selfie with the Duchess after giving her a bunch of flowers. An earlier selfie from the tour, of Kate high-fiving a youngster in Christchurch on Monday, has already been retweeted hundreds of times with the hashtag #besteverselfie. The couple arrived in Australia yesterday with eight-month-old Prince George who was sporting a white smocked romper suit with leather pre-walking shoes. High five! An unnamed teenager from New Zealand takes a selfie during William and Kate's visit to Christchurch . Caught on camera: Chloe Skafte, a 19-year-old student, took a selfie with the Duchess at Sydney Opera House . Waving his arms and kicking his legs, . the little prince appeared to reach out and shake the hand of members of . the official welcoming party and took a keen interest in the posy of . flowers Kate was presented with. Once the official welcomes were over, it was the turn of George’s Spanish-born nanny, Maria Teresa Turrion Borrallo, to carry him. It is the first time Miss Turrion Borrallo has been photographed holding George and she placed him carefully in a car seat inside an official limousine. The prince was given his own police escort to Admiralty House, the official residence in Kirribilli of the Governor-General – the Queen’s official representative in Australia – where the royal party will stay for five days.

Meanwhile William and Kate travelled to Sydney Opera House for an official reception to welcome them to Australia. Thousands of members of the public gathered to catch a glimpse of the royal couple. Well-wishers complimented Kate on her elegant yellow dress – although the Duchess confided to one onlooker: ‘William said I look like a banana.’ After a walkabout it was time for a boat ride across the harbour to Admiralty House, where Kate and William were reunited with their son. In his mother’s arms once more, George looked delighted as he was presented with a giant cuddly toy wombat by the Governor-General Sir Peter Cosgrove. 109668 . 91394 . 43296 . 80448 . 96154 . 128128 . 39616 . 150592 . 86016 . 160984 . 104560 . 379972 . 66224 . 85427 . 97455 .

         "By . Nick Enoch . Star trails sweep over the Giant’s Causeway in Northern Ireland, dust clouds are moulded into colossal arrangements by cosmic radiation thousands of light years away and a bright meteor races across the night sky passing over Indonesia’s smoke-spewing Mount Bromo. These are just some of the incredible photos which have been shortlisted in the 2014 Astronomy Photographer of the Year competition. The contest, run by the Royal Observatory Greenwich in association with BBC Sky at Night Magazine, is now in its sixth year - and a record number of entries from more than 2,500 enthusiastic amateurs and professional photographers have poured in from around the world. Centre of the Heart Nebula by Ivan Eder, Hungary. Situated 7,500 light years away in the W-shaped constellation of Cassiopeia, the Heart Nebula is a vast region of glowing gas, energised by a cluster of young stars at its centre. The image depicts the central region, where dust clouds are being eroded and moulded into rugged shapes by the searing cosmic radiation . What the...! by Tommy Richardsen, Norway. A flamboyant flare-up of the aurora over Steinsvik beach, in Nordreisa, Troms, Norway. It lasted no more than ten minutes from start to finish but it lit up the entire sky and took the photographer by surprise, just as he was about to leave the shoot. The figure on the right is his brother, furiously searching for his lens cap to capture the same phenomenon. It was hard for the photographer not to laugh at his brother while moving the camera left to right capturing the panorama, but luckily he stood still long enough to make the final capture . Father and Son Observe Comet PanSTARRS by Chris Cook, USA. They saw the evening display on First Encounter Beach, Eastham, Massachusetts. The photographer had spent weeks preparing the shoot to capture the comet, which will not be seen again for over 100,000 years, in order to foster his son's interest in astronomy . Eclipse and Old Faithful (left) by Robert Howell, USA. Visitors witness the Old Faithful geyser in Yellowstone National Park erupt as the moon partially eclipses the sun. The scene captures a sense of awe set against blue sky and white geyser steam, as the onlookers strain to see the joining of these two phenomena - one geological and one astronomical. Right, A Giant's Star Trail by Rob Oliver, UK. A composition of several images taken at the famed Giant's Causeway in Northern Ireland. Our planet's rotation draws the stars out into circles - considered to be the most perfect shape by ancient philosophers . Occultation of Jupiter by Sebastián Guillermaz, Argentina. An unusual daytime view of an astronomical alignment, captured from the photographer's backyard in Los Polvorines, Buenos Aires. The image shows the moments just before the planet Jupiter is blocked from view by the moon. The planet can be seen as a pale dot to the right of the moon's body . Cave With Aurora Skylight by Ingólfur Bjargmundsson, Iceland. This image was taken while exploring a 1,300m lava cave in Iceland. In some areas, the roof has caved in, so snow piles up in the winter time and creates these snow peaks. The aurora at its peak gleams through the roof of the cave and despite only taking up a small portion of the photo, it remains the focal point . Shortlisted entries - of which there are more than 120 - include the magnificent pageantry of aurora dancing above the clouds taken from the window of a transatlantic flight between London and New York and the remarkable scene of the Milky Way reflected in the Snake River at the famous Oxbow Bend of Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming. Another image shows a crowd of awestruck onlookers taking in the spectacular solar eclipse gleaming through the steam as the Old Faithful Geyser erupts in Yellowstone National Park. And the variety of settings is not limited to our planet. Photographers have also captured sights from across our Solar System, galaxy and even further afield. Eta Aquarid Meteor Shower over Mount Bromo by Justin Ng, Singapore. A bright meteor streaks across the magnificent night sky over the smoke-spewing Mount Bromo just one day before the peak of the Eta Aquarid meteor shower, which is caused by Halley's Comet. Mount Bromo is one of the most well-known active volcanoes in East Java, Indonesia. Also seen in the photograph are the highest active volcano, Mount Semeru (3,676m), and the extinct volcano, Mount Batok, which is located to the right of Mount Bromo . Orion Nebula by Anna Morris, USA. In this view of M42, more commonly known as the Orion Nebula, the photographer has emphasised the delicate veils of dust surrounding the more familiar gleaming heart of the nebula. The image highlights the structure of the object, giving a sense of vast cavities filled with pink hydrogen gas and the blue haze of reflected starlight . In-flight Entertainment by Paul Williams, UK. Resplendent aurora seen from the window of a transatlantic flight between London and New York in February 2014. The photographer balanced his camera on his backpack to capture this image of the greatest natural light show on earth from a rare perspective . The Turbulent Heart of the Scorpion by Rolf Wahl Olsen, New Zealand. A spectacular display of light and shade with contrasting hues of the rarely imaged, colourful, action-packed core of the multiple star system, Rho Ophiuchi. A deep exposure showcases the full finery of the delicate whirling clouds, of an area in which the human eye would struggle to see much detail, even with the use of a telescope . Three Planets in Conjunction by Lóránd Fényes, Hungary. The staggering colours of the sunset and flora of the African savannah afford a unique background for the planetary alignment of Jupiter, Venus and Mercury in June 2013. The golden hues of the sunrise, the three planets appeared as if they were strung on an invisible thread, and the bare tree and the human figure interwoven both point to one direction: Jupiter . Celestial Dance by Claus Possberg, Germany. The spectacular Northern Lights pictured unfolding over a fjord, in Skjervøy, Troms, Norway. The vibrant colours are produced at various altitudes by different atmospheric gases, with blue light emitted by nitrogen and green by oxygen. Red light can be produced by both gases, while purples, pinks and yellows occur where the various colours mix and intersect . Geminid Fireball by Patrick Cullis, USA. The Geminid meteor shower races over the Flatirons of Boulder, Colorado, in December 2012. Here, a larger than usual fragment burns bright enough to outshine all of the planets, producing what is commonly called a Fireball. Orion can also be seen in the photograph trailing across the sky toward the Pleiades and the glow of Jupiter inside the constellation of Taurus . The photos include a rare daytime scene of Jupiter moments before its astronomical alignment behind the body of the moon; the searing heat of the Crescent Nebula glowing in a whirl of red and blue; and the sprawling stellar nursery of the Orion Nebula 1,350 light years away and home to stars at diverse stages of their lives. The competition’s judges include space scientist and TV presenter Dr Maggie Aderin-Pocock, Editor of Sky at Night Magazine Chris Bramley and the Royal Observatory’s Public Astronomer Dr Marek Kukula. The winners of the four categories and three special prizes will be announced on September 17 and an exhibition of the winning images opens the following day at the Royal Observatory. The exhibition is free of charge and runs until February 2015. Winners and shortlisted entries will also be published in the competition’s official book, available on September 18 from bookstores and online. All entries to the competition were submitted via a dedicated Flickr group (www.flickr.com/groups/astrophoto). The awards ceremony can be followed live on Twitter #astrophoto2014. Oxbow Bend Reflections by David Kingham, USA. The Milky Way reflected in the Snake River at the famous Oxbow Bend in Grand Teton National Park, Wyoming. The galaxy is poised just above the horizon mimicking a glowing cloud . Star Trails on the Beach by Sebastián Guillermaz, Argentina. Multiple shots have been used to produce a time-lapse effect, as the Earth's rotation draws the light from the stars into long trails arcing over the beach in Mar de Ajo, Buenos Aires Province . Creature by Ole Christian Salomonsen, Norway. On October 30, a CME (Coronal Mass Ejection) hit Earth, displaying multi-coloured auroras across the sky for most of the night in Kattfjordeidet, Tromsø. The old birch trees resemble arms reaching for the auroral corona appearing like a strange creature in the sky . NGC 6888 by Mark Hanson, USA. This colourful starscape taken from Rancho Hidalgo, New Mexico, reveals the searing heat of the Crescent Nebula glowing in a whirl of red and blue. The emission nebula is a colossal shell of material ejected from a powerful but short-lived Wolf-Rayet star (WR 136), seen close to the image centre. Ultraviolet radiation and stellar wind now heats the swelling cloud, causing it to glow ."

         "A Conservative MP insisted today that he had been misunderstood after sparking a major backlash by dismissing the Olympic opening ceremony as 'leftie multicultural c***'. Aidan Burley, who was forced to quit as a ministerial aide after attending a Nazi-themed stag do last year, delivered the barbs on Twitter during the event last night. But despite the politician's gripes with Danny Boyle's extravaganza, it proved a huge hit with the public, with 26.9million UK viewers tuning in to watch - the biggest British TV audience for 14 years. Scroll down for video . Spectacular ceremony: Performers enact the work of the NHS and Great Ormond Street Hospital in front of the rising spectre of Lord Voldemort from the Harry Potter novels . 'Foolish': Tory MP Aidan Burley, pictured with David Cameron in December, was last month sacked from his post as a ministerial aide . Backing down: Mr Burley's posts on Twitter, shown in reverse chronological order . One of Mr Burley's posts read: 'The most . leftie opening ceremony I have ever seen - more than Beijing, the . capital of a communist state! Welfare tribute next?' Shortly afterwards he added: 'Thank God the athletes have arrived! Now we can move on from leftie multicultural c***. Bring back red arrows, Shakespeare and the Stones!' Last night's event featured a flamboyant tribute to the NHS, in which staff and patients from the world-famous Great Ormond Street Hospital (Gosh) were given a special cheer as the hospital's name was spelt out by the beds. The Royal Navy, Army and Air Force raised the Union Flag, as the National Anthem rang out from Kaos, a singing choir for deaf and hard of hearing children. Mr Burley's tweets caused an avalanche of criticism on the social networking site, including from fellow Conservative Gavin Barwell. 'With respect, us Londoners are rather proud of the diversity of our city #nothingleftwingaboutit,' the Croydon MP tweeted to Mr Burley. Downing Street moved quickly to distance Prime Minister David Cameron from the comments, with a senior source saying simply: 'We do not agree with him.' The MP for Cannock Chase, Staffordshire, could also be facing a fight to keep hold of his seat after former footballer Stan Collymore, who hails from the area, angrily replied: 'I'll happily stand against you at the next election. You have no clue about our town or its people.' Mr Burley was touted as a rising Tory star when he won Cannock Chase in 2010 with a huge swing from Labour. Challenge: Former footballer Stan Collymore, who hails from Mr Burley's constituency, attacks the MP's comments . Rival: Labour's Lord Prescott weighs in . However, he lost his job as a . parliamentary private secretary when details emerged of a stag do he . attended in the skiing resort of Val Thorens last December. One guest was alleged to have dressed in an SS uniform while others were said to have chanted Nazi slogans. Mr Burley has repeatedly apologised for being present at the event, which is being investigated by French police, but denied behaving badly himself or breaking the law. In the early hours of this morning, the MP sought to placate anger over his Olympics remarks, posting the message: 'Seems my tweet has been misunderstood. I was talking about the way it was handled in the show, not multiculturalism itself.' London Mayor Boris Johnson added his voice to a barrage of criticism levelled at Mr Burley, dismissing the comments as 'nonsense'. Visiting the Olympic Park on the first day of the Games, the capital's Conservative leader said: 'It was actually the truth about this country in the last two or three hundred years told in a big, dynamic way. 'People say it was all leftie stuff. That is nonsense. I'm a Conservative and I had hot tears of patriotic pride from the beginning. I was blubbing like Andy Murray.' Tribute: Children representing the Great Ormond Street Hospital, the NHS and children's literature take part in the ceremony . Political statement? Boyle's NHS scene prompted Mr Burley to claim the tone was more left-wing than the 2008 ceremony in communist China . Inclusive: A choir of deaf and hard-of-hearing children perform in the opening ceremony . Costly: Tony Gallagher, editor of the Daily Telegraph, suggests Mr Burley's job could be under threat . He added: 'The thing I loved was the . heavy political stuff. I loved the emergence of the urban proletariat . and the rise of the chimneys and the forging of the ring.' Labour MP David Winnick said: 'I . would have thought that the general reaction in Government and amongst . senior ministers is that a period of silence on Mr Burley's part would . be much appreciated. 'The . fact of the matter is that his comments were totally inane, . anti-British and at variance with the feeling of millions of people up . and down the country over the success of last night's opening. 'A great number of people in Cannock, including many who voted for him, will be wishing they had a different MP.' Aidan Burley might have bemoaned the ceremony's supposedly socialist tone, but for the VIPs and dignitaries in attendance, the food on offer at a Buckingham Palace reception was positively bourgeois. Guests included David Cameron, Nick Clegg and Michelle Obama. But it was France's PM Jean-Marc Ayrault who must have felt most at home, as almost everything on the menu came with an elaborate French name. Among the cold dishes were Oeufs de Caille et Sel de Celeri and Cornet de Canard Fume Melon de Charentais. Hot dishes included Gateau d’Aigrefin Fume et Poireaux and Langoustines a l’Outhier, while for dessert the guests were served Financier au Chocolat et Cerises - a real mouthful. Labour . frontbencher Michael Dugher said: 'David Cameron should show some . leadership and demand a full apology from Aidan Burley immediately. 'Burley has got form. His comments were stupid, ignorant and offensive. 'David . Cameron has said that the Conservative Party has changed but it is . clear from the words of his own MP that not a lot has changed.' The opening ceremony, in which the Queen had a starring role, featured a diverse cast including James Bond star Daniel Craig and writer JK Rowling - merging music, dance and special effects into a spectacular opening. The worldwide audience was treated to a greatest hits medley of British pop over the decades with bursts of the Beatles, the Jam, Sex Pistols and Dizzee Rascal. There were also excerpts from the Kinks, Frankie Goes To Hollywood and Mud's Tiger Feet before Emeli Sande sang the cup final classic Abide With Me. The average audience for the show - which ran from 9pm until 12.50am - was 22.4million. It is the highest rating since 1998's England-Argentina World Cup clash screened by ITV, which drew 23.78million. The most watched British broadcast in the past 20 years was Princess Diana's funeral in September 1997, with 32.1million viewers split across BBC1 and ITV. Danny Boyle's masterpiece was the biggest BBC1 show since an edition of Only Fools And Horses in 1996. BBC1 controller Danny Cohen said: 'BBC1 is all about bringing the nation together for its biggest moments, and I'm thrilled by the huge audiences who tuned in to watch last night's historic events. 'Danny Boyle's opening ceremony was an absolute triumph. I am very proud of the two BBC Drama films that formed part of the ceremony - the audience response to the film featuring Her Majesty the Queen and James Bond was one of my highlights.' Peak viewing figures of 23.2 million were recorded for England's Euro 2012 quarter-final against Italy last month, while 17.1 million watched the Wimbledon final between Andy Murray and Roger Federer.

         "A controversial ‘seduction artist’ accused of encouraging violence against women now faces a ban from entering the UK, it emerged last night. Julien Blanc runs a ‘pick up’ company for men which critics say uses sexually abusive methods to attract women and encourages his clients to treat women badly. He was expected to come to Britain next week to run a two day seminar, but campaigners have demanded he is blocked from entering. Scroll down for video . 'Pick-up artist' Julien Blanc has been criticised over his sexually abusive and racist methods . Home Secretary Theresa May – who has a long record of refusing those whose views and behaviour she considers unacceptable, is expected to intervene in the case. Last week a minister in her department, Liberal Democrat Lynne Featherstone, said she was lobbying Mrs May to refuse Mr Blanc a visa. Video footage shows the 25-year-old Mr Blanc using racist language and apparently grabbing women by the throat. His other proposed methods include threatening to commit suicide and isolating women from their friends. One comment posted on his Twitter feed stated: ‘Dear girls, could you please save me the effort and roofie (spike) your own drink? #JustKidding’ . Video footage shows the 25-year-old using racist language and apparently grabbing women by the throat . He was expected to come to Britain next week to run a two day seminar, pictured with comedian Russell Brand (left) His website suggests that men who are otherwise not successful at meeting women can ‘shortcircuit’ their target’s ‘emotional and logical mind.’ Miss Featherstone said she was ‘extremely concerned by the sexist and utterly abhorrent statements Julien Blanc has made about women’. She claimed his appearance in the UK would lead to an increase in sexual harrassment and intimidation of women. Labour’s shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper has also called for Mr Blanc to be barred. A YouTube video shows Mr Blanc on the streets of Tokyo grabbing young women and pushing their heads towards his groin. He describes ‘romping through the streets just grabbing girls’. A blog post describes how to use ‘use coercion and threats’ and ‘emotional abuse’ to control women. Home Secretary Theresa May – who has a long record of refusing those whose views and behaviour she considers unacceptable, is expected to intervene in the case . It states: ‘Makes threats to hurt her; make her drop charges; make her do illegal things; threaten to report her to welfare; prevent her from taking a job; take her money and humiliate her.’ He was forced to leave Australia last week when his visa was cancelled. A similar campaign was mounted to bar him from Canada. A petition calling for him to be refused entry to the UK has received more than 136,000 signatures. The woman behind the petition, who goes by the pseudonym of Caroline Charles said: ‘Julien Blanc dresses up his seminars as dating advice, which at best is disingenuous - he focuses on tricking women into having sex in order to make money. ‘It is wrong on every level - it is promoting violene against women and girls, it takes advantage of men and it sends a message to survivors of sexual assault that they will not be listened to. To allow someone into the UK who is explicitly promoting these things is abysmal.’ Other commentators have suggested that the campaign against Mr Blanc merely generates him unwarranted publicity. Blanc’s company, Real Social Dynamics, runs three day courses costing around £1200. His company is due to host a two day course starting on 27th November and another from December 19. Eleven more events are scheduled for next year. Mrs May can use discretionary powers to ban anyone for reasons of ‘unacceptable behaviour’. The Home Office refused to comment on the specific case for legal reasons. A Home Office spokesman said: ‘The Home Secretary has the power to exclude an individual if she considers that his or her presence in the UK is not conducive to the public good.’ Mr Blanc’s representatives did not respond to requests for comment."

         "By . James Chapman . Out: Michael Gove paid the price for his 'toxic' public image which was blamed for turning voters against his school reforms . Michael Gove was demoted yesterday as David Cameron’s election guru Lynton Crosby engineered a ruthless elevation of women and Eurosceptics. The Education Secretary, a hero for the Tory Right, paid the price for his ‘toxic’ public image which was blamed for turning voters against his school reforms. To the alarm of education reformers, he was shifted to become chief whip – a position hailed as ‘one of the most important jobs’ in government by David Cameron, but one which will mean a substantial pay cut and an end to his full Cabinet status. Mr Gove’s former aide, Dominic Cummings, accused the Prime Minister of ‘surrender’. The populist hand of Mr Crosby, the Tories’ Australian chief election strategist, was detected across yesterday’s reshuffle. Designed to turn the Tory top team into an ‘election-winning machine’, it was by far the most extensive shake-up Mr Cameron has carried out in his nine years as party leader. A succession of telegenic women – including two working mothers, Elizabeth Truss and Nicky Morgan – won big promotions. At 38, Miss Truss, tipped as a potential future party leader, became the youngest woman Cabinet minister ever, while Mrs Morgan will replace Mr Gove as Education Secretary. Philip Hammond, appointed as Foreign Secretary after William Hague stood down to become leader of the Commons, was hailed as the most Eurosceptic holder of the post since the Second World War. Opponents of Tory plans to reform European human rights laws, including Attorney General Dominic Grieve, were swept away. In all, 11 male ministers, most of them middle-aged, jumped before they were pushed or were sacked by Mr Cameron. His most difficult exchange is understood to have been with outgoing Environment Secretary Owen Paterson, whose dismissal infuriated some on the Right of the party. The biggest shock was the move out of education for Mr Gove, one of the Prime Minister’s oldest friends and allies. Just weeks ago, Mr Cameron appeared to guarantee him his job during exchanges at Prime Minister’s Questions. Mr Gove, the architect of the Government’s . new free schools, funded by the state but unshackled from council . control, told allies just days ago that he was going nowhere. Shake-up: Lynton Crosby (left), David Cameron's election guru, designed the reshuffle to make the top Tory team an 'election-winning machine'. It's by far the biggest shake-up in the Prime Minister's nine years as leader . But senior figures in Downing Street, including chief of staff Ed Llewellyn, are understood to have been increasingly exasperated by Mr Gove’s public battles with colleagues. In recent months, he has clashed with education minister David Laws and Home Secretary Theresa May, and has maintained a constant state of warfare with an education establishment he branded ‘The Blob’. Mr Crosby is thought to have pointed to polling evidence suggesting Mr Gove’s unpopularity had spread beyond teachers and was contaminating the Government’s education message more widely. One recent YouGov poll showed voters now oppose schools becoming academies by 41 per cent to 31 per cent and Mr Gove’s flagship free schools project by 53 per cent to 23 per cent. Other polling evidence showed the Education Secretary had become one of the most recognisable members of the Government – equal only to Mr Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne – but by far its most unpopular senior minister. Within the past few days Mr Cameron is understood to have spoken to Mr Gove to suggest a move to replace Sir George Young, the outgoing chief whip, who is in charge of party discipline. Traditionally, the role is conducted out of public view, but the Prime Minister sought to sweeten the pill by promising Mr Gove he would be one of his main election advisers and would appear regularly in the media. Former Tory whip Sir Greg Knight said: ‘If the spin is true and we have a chief whip who regularly addresses the nation, I think this will prove a mistake.’ There were claims – hotly disputed by the Treasury – that George Osborne initially opposed the idea of a move for the Education Secretary, who has emerged as the unofficial head of the Chancellor’s campaign to succeed Mr Cameron. Britain's teachers wasted no time in gloating over Michael Gove’s demotion yesterday, going online to share expletive-filled insults and pictures of voodoo dolls to send the Education Secretary on his way. Within hours of the shock announcement, #GoveGone was trending on Twitter amid reports of teachers cheering, ‘weeping with joy’ and high-fiving each other in the corridors of schools around the country. One staff room reportedly even brought out ‘the posh biscuits’ to celebrate. A knitted doll of Mr Gove, stuck with pins, was tweeted by @HPUKStudents, with the message: ‘Nicky Morgan replaces Gove as education secretary. Probably won’t need this any more then.’ Opponents were also encouraged to attack him on Twitter via an online game called ‘Slap Michael Gove’, which saw him being struck hundreds of thousands of times yesterday. There were also mocked-up photos of Mr Gove receiving an ‘F’ in his exam results and being ‘sent to the naughty step’, while he was even likened to a sexually transmitted disease. Trade unionists could not contain their glee as they claimed the NUT strike last week, which caused disruption to thousands of parents and pupils, had successfully ousted Mr Gove. An NUT poster was circulated online, stating: ‘Your pressure has had an impact. Government policy must now urgently change.’ Glee: The NUT poster that was shared online (left) and a mobile phone game which allows you to 'slap Gove' Asked if the change of job represented a ‘punishment’, Mr Cameron insisted: ‘I can tell you, if you are Prime Minister, the chief whip is one of the most important jobs in government. I wanted one of my big hitters, one of my real stars, one of my great brains, someone who has done extraordinary things for education in this country, to do that job, to deliver the Government’s programme, to help secure the future for our country.’ He said he was proud to lead ‘a fresh team with the ideas, the energy and the ability to take this country forward’. Aides . insisted Mrs Morgan was ‘100 per cent’ behind Mr Gove’s reforms. Mr Gove . insisted the Prime Minister had given him the choice of taking charge . of the whips’ office or staying where he was. He appeared unaware that . the move will mean taking a pay cut – from £141,647 to £103,937. He . admitted: ‘It’s naturally a wrench to be moved from a job I love … . Demotion, emotion, locomotion, whatever I’m engaged in today, I’m . pushing forward the Government’s agenda.’ There was dismay on the Right of the Conservative Party at his move. Senior MPs questioned why Miss Truss, who was Mr Gove’s deputy as schools minister, had not been promoted to take the job if there was no desire to signal a break with his agenda. There were indications on unhappiness in the party at the scale of Mr Cameron’s purge. Centrists were dismayed at the departure of pro-European veteran Kenneth Clarke, Mr Grieve, who had defended the European court of human rights, and climate change minister Greg Barker. Former Tory MP Louise Mensch claimed the ‘desire for publicity’ of Mr Gove’s former aide Mr Cummings, who has been scathing about Mr Cameron and his senior officials, had ‘got the best education secretary we’ve ever had sacked’. Mr Cummings dismissed that accusation and suggested instead it was a surprise that Mr Gove had lasted so long. He added: ‘We got away with subverting every Whitehall and Number Ten process, and it took David Cameron four years to surrender. We assumed he would in 2012 and 2013.’"

He admitted changing his . plans 'cost more in the end but its (sic) the principle of it'. Low-cost airline Ryanair has issued a sarcastic riposte to the singer's comments. After reading McFadden's angry four-tweet rant, airline spokesman Robin Kiely told MailOnline: 'We’re . surprised that Mr McFadden, having agreed to print his boarding card, couldn’t . manage this super-complex task, which is accomplished daily by over 80million . passengers annually.' The company's notoriously outspoken chief executive Michael O'Leary has previously branded those who object to paying a penalty for failing to print their own boarding cards as ‘idiots’ who should ‘b***** off’. The outspoken chief executive of the budget airline said passengers who arrive for flights without a pass are ‘stupid’ and it is right they are charged £60 a time to have one printed at the check-in desk because it is their ‘**** up’. 'Loopholes': Former Westlife star Brian McFadden was told by Ryanair he would have to pay a total of £150 on top of the cost of his flight to print a boarding pass and for extra luggage allowance . Making his own way to Spain: The singer decided to change his plans despite admitting it cost him more than the £150 charges . His . remarks were made in September last year after passenger Suzy McLeod was . forced to pay £236 to print boarding passes for herself, her parents, . and her two children so they could fly home to Britain from Alicante, . Spain. McFadden's followers soon shared their similar experiences of having to pay extra charges. One, Helen Lord, said: 'we . fly with them next week, cost more for my 5 month old daughter who has . no seat, than an adult fare #gofigure\".' Another, Rebecca Jones, waded in . with: 'I've just come back from alicante on Ryanair...nightmare!!!! I won't be flying with them again anytime soon!!!' Irish eyes are definitely not smiling: Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary felt the wrath of his fellow countryman McFadden on Twitter ."

         "Tottenham Hotspur forward Harry Kane has signed a new five-and-a-half-year contract to remain at White Hart Lane. The England Under 21 forward has firmly established himself in the Spurs line-up this season under Mauricio Pochettino. The deal sees the 21-year-old commit his future to the north London club until 2020 - on terms of £45,000 a week. Tottenham Hotspur striker Harry Kane has signed a new five-and-a-half-year contract with the club . Kane has been tipped to be in Roy Hodgson's squad for England's upcoming March internationals . Age: 21 (D.O.B. 28.07.93) Born: Walthamstow, England . Clubs: Tottenham Hotspur (2009-), Leyton Orient (2011), Millwall (2012), Norwich City (loan, 2012-13, Leicester City (loan, 2013) Career goals: 41 . Goals this season: 20 (10 in Premier League) Kane has been in magnificent form this season, netting 20 goals in 33 appearances. In 19 Premier League appearances, Kane has scored 10 times - including twice during Spurs' 3-0 win at West Bromwich Albion on Saturday. Kane tweeted after signing the deal: 'Very happy to have signed my new contract at Spurs! Excited for the future ahead! Thank you for all your messages! #COYS.' He also told the Spurs website: 'It's been a great six months. I've been really pleased with how things have gone. This (contract) is another stepping stone and hopefully now I'll push on again from this and get even better. 'All you can do as a footballer is try to get better and better and that's what I aim to do, to get better, score more goals and play better for the team,' he added. 'I'm really looking forward to the rest of the season. Kane scores from the penalty spot during Spurs' 3-0 win at West Bromwich Albion on Saturday . 'I'm only 21 and I've a lot of football ahead of me. I'll keep my feet on the ground and keep working hard for the team and for the club. I've been at Spurs since I was 11 and always loved the club. I've been here 10 years now and hopefully there are many more good times to come.' Loan spells earlier in Kane's career at Leyton Orient, Millwall, Norwich City and Leicester City helped the forward hone his skills. However, this season Kane has become a mainstay of Pochettino's side - leapfrogging the likes of Emmanuel Adebayor and Roberto Soldado in the pecking order. Kane holds his arms aloft after scoring against Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park earlier this month . In a statement released by Tottenham on their website, they said: 'The club is delighted to announce that Harry Kane has signed a new five-and-a-half-year contract which runs until 2020. 'The young striker, still only 21, has been in outstanding form for us this season with 20 goals in all competitions, including a memorable double against Premier League leaders Chelsea at the Lane on New Year's Day. 'An academy graduate, Harry made his first-team debut against Hearts in the Europa League in August 2011 and made his big breakthrough last season when he scored on his first Premier League start for us against Sunderland in April - the first of three goals in consecutive league games. 'A Spurs fan born locally in Walthamstow, Harry has also impressed on international duty, having represented England at Under 17, 19 and 20 level, while his record for the Under 21 side currently stands at eight goals from 10 games.' The England Under 21 forward claps the Spurs fans following his double against West Bromwich Albion ."

         "The online activist group, known as Anonymous, has threatened to shut down Zynga and Facebook, days after the gaming giant announced it was laying off 5 per cent of its workforce. The group is targeting the San Francisco based company because of 'the outrageous treatment of their employees and their actions against many developers,' an unidentified member of the group, donning their trademark Guy Fawkes mask, announced in a YouTube video posted on Sunday. Slamming the tech firm for slashing its employee base while sitting on 'billion dollars cash,' the hackers threatened to release games it has stolen from Zynga's server, in addition to shutting down both Zynga and Facebook on November 5. Scroll down for video. Warning: The online activist group known as Anonymous has threatened to shut down Zynga and Facebook on November 5, which marks Guy Fawkes Day . Threat: The group planned its attack in retaliation against Zynga's announcement it would cut 5 per cent of its staff and would outsource many of those jobs to India . The looming threat to take down the social networking sites comes after Zynga unveiled a restructuring plan in the wake of its disappointing third quarter earnings report on October 24. Zynga CEO Mark Pincus announced last week it would lay off five per cent of its workforce, of approximately 3,000, shutting down its office in Boston and slashing the staff at the company's Austin branch. The company is also said to be looking at closing operations in the UK and Japan. The downsizing came as Zynga announced the company lost $52.7 million, or 7 cents per share in the past quarter. The company CEO described the layoffs . as necessary 'to streamline our operations, focus our resources on our . most strategic opportunities, and invest in our future,' in a memo to . staff last week. 'As part of these changes, we’ve had . to make some tough decisions around products, teams and people.' Plan: The group dubbed their campaing #OP maZYNGA and plans to roll out their attack in multiple phases . Layoffs: Zynga CEO Mark Pincus (speaking at a San Francisco event on October 11) said last week the layoffs were necessary 'to streamline operations' 'We don’t take these decisions . lightly as we recognize the impact to our colleagues and friends who . have been on this journey with us. We appreciate their amazing . contributions and will miss them.' In addition to staff cuts, the company is also retiring some of its older games. Though Zynga dominated the early . online gaming market, with its widely popular FarmVille and Words With Friends, it has been . losing out to competitors like King.com, Wooga and Kixeye, in addition . to the mobile arena where it has lost market share. The latest news from Zynga could mean . even more problems for Facebook, as the gaming unit accounted for 14 per . cent of Facebook's total revenue for the first six months of 2012. Facebook has failed to impress Wall . Street in the aftermath of its hyped IPO in May, as many analysts wonder . if Mark Zuckerberg can really deliver a profit. Gaming giant: Zynga (pictured: the company headquarters in San Francisco) opened in 2003 and developed FarmVille and Words With Friends. It accounted for 14 per cent of Facebook's revenue in the past six months . That said, Zynga has announced it . will enter the gambling business and combined with its cost cutting . measures and staff reductions, shares were actually up last Wednesday as investors seemed . pleased with the company's vision to move past this rough patch. So with its stock on the rise, the . online group is taking on the gaming giant - accusing the company of throwing its employees . under the bus while executives reap the benefits of increased investor . confidence. In an operation dubbed #OP maZYNGA, a . posting from Anonymous on the AnonNews website stated it would retaliate with a multiphase . effort to hit the tech company where it hurts. The group has claimed to have . accessed Zynga's server and has obtained confidential . communication to executives about the company's strategy, which . allegedly includes plans for further layoffs and increased outsourcing to . Bangalore, India. In the next phase of its attack, Anonymous plans to release code of Zynga games and even plans to shut . down both the gaming site and Facebook. Zynga customers and Facebook users, We are anonymous. During the last few days anonymous has been targeting Zynga for the outrageous treatment of their employees and their actions against many developers. We have come to believe that this actions of Zynga will result in massive layoff of a thousand people and legal actions against everyone that speaks to the public about this plan. It will also come to end of the US game market as we know it as all this jobs will be replaced in other more convenient financial countries. With a billion dollars cash sitting in a bank we do believe that such actions are an insult to the population and the behaviour of corporations like Zynga must change. Anonymous could not allow this to happen so it's starting to release confidential documents we have leaked on this plan. As we speak we are planning to release also all the games we've taken from their servers for free. That being said we will stop the idea of the distribution of such games if Zynga will cease immediately the plan. 'On November the fifth we will release the key to the data files. Remember, remember the 5TH of November,' the group said. November 5 marks Guy Fawkes Day, which commemorates the day in 1605 when Guy Fawkes joined a group of Roman Catholic conspirators who tried to blow up the British Parliament. The group of hackers, whose members don masks . of the English rebellion leader, are a loosely organized body who protest government surveillance of the web. They have taken responsibility for taking down many government websites, in addition to launching cyber attacks on major corporations. The internet social activists formed . in 2003 and have since thrown their support behind progressive causes . like Julian Assange's WikiLeaks and Occupy Wall Street. Anonymous had previously threatened to shut down Facebook on November 5, 2011. 'If you are a willing hacktivist or a guy who just wants to protect the freedom of information then join the cause and kill Facebook for the sake of your own privacy,' the group said in a statement last year about the lack of privacy on the site. 'Facebook has been selling information to government agencies and giving clandestine access to information security firms so that they can spy on people from all around the world.'

         "#UNGA, #ISIS, #terrorists, #ISIS, #ISIS, #terrorist, #nuclear",
         "(CNN) -- Leaders from Britain and Iran met Wednesday for the first time in 35 years, a potential breakthrough conversation that occurs at a time when Tehran is trying to shed Western-led sanctions over its nuclear program and Western nations are trying to garner international support for their campaign against ISIS. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani acknowledged the meeting between him and British Prime Minister David Cameron with a tweet -- picture included -- from the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York. \"1 hour of constructive & pragmatic dialogue, new outlook #UNGA,\" read his message on the Cameron meeting. During his U.N. speech later Wednesday, Cameron talked about the meeting, the first since the 1979 Iranian Revolution. After talking about the need for the anti-ISIS coalition to be \"inclusive, engaging the widest possible coalition of countries as possible,\" Cameron touched on his conversation with Rouhani. The two leaders have \"severe disagreements,\" Cameron said, pointing to \"Iran's support for terrorist organizations, its nuclear program, its treatment of its people. All these need to change.\" Then again, Cameron added, \"Iran's leaders could help in defeating the threat from ISIL,\" using a commonly used acronym for ISIS, which calls itself the Islamic State. \"They could help secure a more stable and inclusive Iraq and a more stable and inclusive Syria,\" he said. \"And if they are prepared to do this, then we should welcome their engagement.\" Cameron's comments came after the UK mission to the United Nations put out a statement on the meeting, saying the two leaders \"agreed that we should seek to progressively improve our bilateral relationship.\" That statement referenced addressing \"the future of Iran's nuclear program.\" That remains a focus in Tehran, though the hot topic this week at the United Nations is what to do about ISIS. ISIS consists of Sunni Muslims aiming to create a vast caliphate in the region under its strict, distinct version of Sharia law. Its advances into neighboring Iraq could pose a threat to Iran, especially given that Iran is made up predominantly of Shiite Muslims. In fact, Iranian leaders have voiced support for Iraq's government -- which is also led by Shiites -- in its fight against the Islamic extremist organization. Brig. Gen. Amir-Ali Hajizadeh even said that members of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard \"stopped\" ISIS from entering the Kurdish city of Irbil, according to a report Wednesday from state-run Press TV. But, in the same story, Hajizadeh ripped the U.S.-led anti-ISIS coalition as part of Washington's \"psychological warfare\" policy. Rouhani on Wednesday criticized the coalition airstrikes in Syria, saying they do not have \"any legal standing\" because U.N. members haven't sanctioned them. Iran has been one of the biggest allies of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, the man who U.S. President Barack Obama and other Western leaders have publicly said they want out of power -- even going so far as to support moderate opposition elements fighting to oust him. Rouhani used rhetorical questions to make his case on Twitter, writing, \"Wasn't DAESH (#ISIS) the same group who fought the Syrian gov & the Syrian army? How is that they were not categorised as #terrorists then?\" Saying that his country never \"had doubts or delays in countering #ISIS,\" Rouhani tweeted, \"Why is it that #ISIS went from not-so-bad to extremely-bad depending on who they had targeted in their #terrorist operations?\" Notwithstanding such criticism and the fact he didn't meet with Obama in New York, Rouhani didn't close the door to major changes in his nation's relationship with its longstanding, often bitter rival, the United States. \"If we are able to reach a #nuclear agreement,\" Rouhani tweeted, \"a new atmosphere would emerge in US-Iran relations, which I believe would benefit both nations.\""

         "(CNN)Uber's route to the top has been pockmarked with scandal, from its acrobatic approach to transport regulations to the alleged misogyny of CEO Travis Kalanick. But fresh claims that the company puts journalists and users under surveillance, and appropriates their data, could pose an existential threat. The taxi-disrupting service has faced a severe backlash, with analysts and bloggers excoriating the company culture, and the viral campaign #deleteuber thriving across social platforms. In response to the battering, the \"most arrogant startup in Silicon Valley\" has been forced onto the defensive. Representatives are emphasizing customer care and community values at the heart of their mission, breaking with their ruthless image. But if bad publicity has darkened Uber's name it has not damaged its performance. After its latest round of funding, the company is valued at around $40 billion, and the service has expanded its availability from 60 cities in 2013 to over 200 today. \"At this point it's a reputation crisis but is not specific to the job they are doing,\" says Dr. Audra Diers-Lawson, a specialist in crisis management at the University of Manchester. \"The reason Uber is still growing is that people still view them as a good service. If there was a problem with the rides we would see a much more immediate effect.\" Audra compares the situation with BP's plummeting stock in the wake of the Gulf of Mexico spill -- \"a material crisis, related to their primary function\" -- that is still depressing the company's performance several years later. Uber's crisis is far from unique. In a digital age, reputation has never been harder to safeguard. \"Social media has made the world more transparent so bad news travels faster and spreads further,\" says Jonathan Hemus, founder of reputation management company Insignia Communications. \"I would say reputation risk is higher than ever before.\" Given the volume of online opinion, much of it from anonymous critics that could be trolls or competitors in disguise, companies need not always take heed of it. \"Sometimes its better to let it go away,\" says Justin Fox, executive editor of the Harvard Business Review. \"Large, established organizations can ignore petty complaints but must decide who to pay attention to. Every company checks the Klout of its critics.\" In some cases, companies have chosen to court controversy and prospered, such as with Ryanair and its combative Chief Executive Michael O' Leary who has often seemed to relish confrontation but posted record profits nonetheless. \"It seems negative but is consistent with the image they want,\" says Fox. Even spats over charging customers for water or toilet use is \"still spreading the message 'we are really cheap'.\" A bad reputation can be a blessing says Noel Biderman, CEO of Ashley Madison, a matchmaking service for married people that is thriving despite more opprobrium than Uber has yet faced. The self-styled \"King of Infidelity\" empathizes with their situation. \"If you're a disruptive business shaking up an existing paradigm you know you will get flak, and you need to have your story straight. Ours is about shifting values in society and in people's behavior.\" \"Actors from mainstream TV shows are often told 'go and create controversy, let people see your flaws.' It gives them an edge. It can be the same for a company.\" A pristine reputation may also be of lesser importance to larger brands, that are better insulated against reputation damage. Department stores such as Wal-Mart and Asda have been regular targets for consumer campaigns, but have continued to thrive through their ability to undercut competitors with lower priced goods. Monsanto have also shown that a dominant position in the market can compensate for negative impressions. But such respite is only temporary, says Jonathan Hemus. Eventually a bad reputation will catch up with any business. \"In the longer term, no business can afford to maintain a negative reputation. Most successful businesses combine a fantastic product and service with strong, positive reputations and relationships.\" \"It's possible to recover a reputation, which depends on rebuilding trust and confidence...you have to address the root cause of a problem, and prove you're taking action to stop it happening.\" For Uber, there are numerous threats on the horizon that could make an image problem into a wholesale crisis, including tightened regulations, disgruntled drivers, and competitors such as Lyft that can trade off a comparatively friendly reputation. So can they turn it around? \"Not with this leadership,\" says Audra Diers-Lawson. \"The first thing they need is a new CEO.\" Read more: why your business wont grow without a virtual assistant .

         "(CNN) -- In the end, it was always Robin. That was the big bombshell from Monday night's final episode of \"How I Met Your Mother,\" which piled on one surprise after another. When Ted finally finished the story for his kids, they called him on it: His story wasn't all about how he met their mother (she was barely in the story), it was about how much he loved Robin. As many had theorized, the mother of Ted's children (whose name was Tracy McConnell, by the way), had been dead for years by the time he told his story. So, in the last of many flash-forwards in this finale, Ted went to the street in front of Robin's apartment and showed up with that blue French horn, the same one he stole for her in the first episode. Robin, of course, had long ago divorced Barney -- the first big shocker of the night. Barney, however, we would learn, became a father, and in one of several touching scenes from the episode, finally found the love of his life in baby Ellie. Marshall and Lily, pregnant with their second child in the present day, went on to have a third, but Lily was heartbroken when Robin decided she couldn't be as much a part of their gang anymore, due in part to Barney continuing to be, well, Barney around her. And what about the mother, aka Tracy? We finally did see that moment of the two meeting at that train station, and it was played perfectly by Josh Radnor and the Emmy-worthy Cristin Milioti. They wouldn't get married for several years, having postponed their wedding when Tracy got pregnant with their first child. Ted shared with his kids that he learned he had to love their mother with everything he had in him, through good times and bad, especially during her illness. Needless to say, the show stayed true to form, as it had in all its nine years, wearing its heart on its sleeve. And if your eyes stayed dry through the entire episode, you're probably a stronger person than most viewers. Of course, the big Robin twist didn't exactly sit well with everyone online (people such as Rocco Horvath @RoccoRacingAMA, who tweeted, \"It took me so long to get over the fact Ted and Robin weren't going to end up together and now this?! Mixed Emotions\"), and the finale seems to have split viewers more than any since \"Lost.\" Other viewers were more forgiving. \"#HIMYM creators stayed true to the story,\" tweeted fan John Eisele. \"Finale fit the show, even if it is not what I wanted. Can't stop thinking about it. #HIMYMFinale.\" What do you think? Do you wish Tracy had stayed alive and Ted didn't ultimately end up with Robin? Or do you think it was a fitting ending? For that matter, what do you think about Barney and Robin splitting up? Let us know in the comments and give yourself a self-five for making it all the way through nine seasons."

         "By . Stephanie Linning . 'Poignant': The body of army cadet instructor Arthur Jones was found near a memorial dedicated in Crete dedicated to Greek cadets who were killed in the First World War . A former army sergeant 'died of heat exhaustion' while paying his respects at a remote war memorial in Crete that he had hiked to in temperatures of 35C. The body of 73-year-old Arthur Jones, an army cadet instructor, was found on Monday near a war memorial dedicated to the Greek cadets killed as they fought against the Nazi invasion. His family added that it was 'very poignant' that he was discovered on . the 100th anniversary of the outbreak of the First World War. The grandfather, from Denbigh, North Wales – described as a veteran . adventurer by his family – went missing on June 19 after going into the . Crete hills on the Greek holiday island. He had sent his family a postcard in the first few days of his holiday, saying he was planning a walking trip. He was last seen by staff at the resort in Chania where he was staying as he set out on what was to be the hottest day of the year in Crete - with temperatures reaching 35C. The father-of-four had been been walking as a hobby for 30-40 years and . had previously trained army cadets mountaineering and hill-climbing. After a six-week air and land search led by the Greek Army, in which helicopters scoured the area near the resort where Mr Jones was last seen, his body was found slumped against a tree near the memorial. His son Jeff, speaking from Crete, said: 'He was found near to this memorial, erected for the cadets which is something my dad was involved with for 30 years. 'He trained army cadets back in Wales. It’s extremely poignant for us. 'My father was obviously looking for this memorial and got lost either on the way there or back. It’s just a very nice last memory for us. 'It seems he passed away in a peaceful and dignified way. As far as we know, he’s been like that for six weeks. It was so hot, that day.' Six-week-search: The Greek Army launched a land and air search after Mr Jones went missing on June 19. Helicopters scoured the area near the resort in Chania, where Mr Jones was last seen by staff . Experienced walker: Grandfather Arthur Jones was last seen setting off into the mountains near Chania, pictured. His son said that it is presumed that he was dehydrated and suffered heat exhaustion . His son said a post-mortem examination revealed no medical episode and it is presumed, based on the remote location and temperature, that he was dehydrated and suffered heat exhaustion. The family has thanked the public and authorities for their support. Adventurer: The father-of-four had been been walking as a hobby for 30-40 years and had previously trained army cadets mountaineering . Jeff added: 'We as a family would like to thank everyone for their support, help and contribution to our quest in finding our father since he went missing six weeks ago. 'The last six weeks have been terribly stressful and difficult to cope with, but we would ask that we have the time, peace and privacy we need to mourn our father.' Arthur’s daughter Angela Jones thanked the public for their 'incredible' support and said she took comfort from the fact her father, who was a keen walker, had been 'doing something he loves'. The mother-of-two added: 'My father has been the best grandfather in the world - and it’s my two girls that it breaks my heart for. They are both under three and he’s been wonderful for them. 'The support we’ve had has been incredible - we couldn’t have asked for any more, it’s meant we have been able to keep going.' Following the disappearance of the former army sergeant June 19, the community of Denbigh united in support of the family and raised more than £20,000, which helped send a local search team out to the Mediterranean island. Mr Jones family members also flew out to help with the search, with relatives bringing with them 1,000 leaflets in Greek and . English, featuring the grandfather's picture, to hand out in the area. People around the world got behind the #FindArthur and #CameronPromised campaigns on Twitter to show their support."

         "Singer Justin Bieber was two hours late for his debut show at the O2 after 'throwing a massive tantrum', ranting at worried staff: 'It's my gig, I will go out when I want to' - it has been claimed. According to backstage sources Justin, 19, was in a foul mood after waking up late because of a night out and the 'stroppy youngster locked himself in his dressing room to play computer games'. Despite being accused of coming onstage two hours after he was billed to, with hundreds of upset teenagers leaving before getting the chance to see their idol, Justin said he was only 40 minutes late on Monday - blaming technical difficulties and saying the gig was 'great'. Gamer: Justin Bieber was apparently two hours late to his show on Monday because he was playing video games and woke up late . One O2 worker, who did not want to be named, told The Sun: 'He was arguing with members of his management, his family. It was a really uncomfortable atmosphere. His attitude was, \"I’m the star and I can do what I want\"'. Another worker, Ellie Grace, said: 'I hope I never have to experience so many upset children and disappointed fans again.' Speaking to Heat magazine, an insider said the 19-year old refused to go onstage before showering, despite desperate pleas from his management to perform. Diva: A source close to the star told Heat magazine that the Canadian threw a tantrum before the Monday night show at the O2 . Tardy: Despite fans complaining, Bieber still maintains he was only 40 minutes late to stage . Curious: Wearing two expensive watches it's a wonder how Justin couldn't see he was late to his own concert . Another backstage source added: 'His . lateness was because he didn’t get out of bed until late and sat in his . dressing room playing games - even though his door was being knocked.' 'He then threw a strop as he said he wanted a shower first, despite already being late.' It is thought Justin arrived at the O2 arena at 3pm 'to do some meet and greets' but he . was suffering after a ' heavy night at his hotel. But the great audience at the O2 weren't the only ones to be disappointed. A . 15-year old fan - who did not want to be named for fear of backlash . from the Belieber community - was 'blanked' by her musical hero even . though she had won a competition to meet him before the show. The unhappy girl told Heat that she and her friends, waited for three hours to see Justin. However, when their idol finally arrived, they say he spent 'less than ten seconds' with him. She also claims the singer declined to give her a hug, ironically telling his fan 'I don't have time.' A source close to Justin said: 'There was no competition winner that we knew or approved of.' 'If it was a radio contest winner who got a meet and greet, they got the same amount of time as everyone else and exactly what was promised.' The rest of the accounts are 'wildly exaggerated or just untrue.' Party doesn't stop! After his show, Justin heads out for another 'good time' in London . Even an O2 staff member witnessed . Justin's alleged diva-like behaviour: . 'He was arguing with members of . his management, his family. It was a really uncomfortable atmosphere. His attitude was, \"I’m the star and I can do what I want\".' Despite . a wealth of attendees confirming his two hour delay to stage, the . Canadian star still maintains he only kept his fans waiting for 40 . minutes. Still popular: Justin Bieber was presented with an official Wembley Way . Stone this week after playing the stadium last year, causing his fans to record . the loudest scream during the Capital FM Summertime Ball . 'Last night i was scheduled after 3 opening acts to go on stage at 935 . not 830 but because of some technical issues i got on at 10:10..so...(sic)' the singer tweeted. Digital Spy also reported that the star is being asked to pay a £300,000 fine to Greenwich Council for causing the gig to run past the 11pm closing time. However, a Royal Borough of Greenwich spokesperson said: ' have not taken any action against the owners of The O2 in relation to Justin Bieber’s recent performance, as no breach of our licensing conditions took place.' Poser: Justin visited Wembley Stadium on Monday to be honoured with his official Wembley Way Stone following his loudest scream recorded at a concert there last year . 'I never have any intent to upset or let anyone down. and Im not okay . with things being exaggerated. once again sorry for anyone upset.(sic)' But to ensure the backlash didn't . continue, the following night's performance saw Justin arrive on stage . two minutes early, according to his official Twitter page. However . it seems the furore hasn't dampened the Girlfriend's singer's feelings . towards the English capital, tweeting a simple message in the early . hours of Wednesday: 'Lovin London. #goodtimes'. And Bieber's popularity doesn't seem to be waning completely either. The Baby hitmaker was presented with his very own Wembley Way Stone this week ahead of his London concerts. Pants down!: Justin Bieber managed to flash his boxers while sitting in his car, giving passerby a glimpse of his bottom . Justin met up with The FA team and headed to Wembley on Monday, where he was inducted into the Wembley Way walk of fame after his performance at last summer’s Capital FM Summertime Ball. Bieber will now be immortalised with a Wembley Way Stone having rocked the stadium last year causing his fans to raise the roof at the national stadium with the loudest scream recorded at the venue.

         "One of the world's top modeling agencies has turned to Instagram in order to scout for new talent. As part of its worldwide We Love Your Genes model search, IMG Models, which looks after the likes of Kate Moss, Karlie Kloss and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, is calling on any eager future fashion stars to upload their best selfies to Instagram, using the hashtag #WLYG. But, determined not to judge the girls on just the one image, the agency's VP of scouting, Jeni Rose, explained to Fashionista that they want each person to create more of a digital portfolio, by posting a series of images which showcase their 'whole personality'. Scroll down for video . Future fashion star: Isabell Klem from Hawaii was one of the first models to be scouted by IMG via her Instagram account. As soon as they spotted her beautiful pictures, they flew her out to New York to meet with them . Blonde hair, blue eyes: Lola Van De Vondervoort posted this image of herself without any make-up on in the hopes of being scouted by IMG's experts . Be yourself: Model Sofia Rivolta, who was recently signed to IMG after they noticed her potential via Instagram, advised other budding fashion stars to avoid using too many filters in their own selfies . 'Instagram allows us to see potential models' natural beauty in their everyday lives,' she said. 'They no longer have to spend lots of money on photo shoots or portfolios. Instead, they can come directly to us with simple smartphone snapshots and a lot of enthusiasm.' While the agency will not yet reveal whether it has successfully signed any of the would-be Instagram models to its books, the official We Love Your Genes Instagram account says that it has already scouted 'dozens' of girls via social media. Ms Rose also admitted that IMG has received more than 14,000 submissions from young women who are eager to join its books. Fresh-faced: Many of the girls include a variety of submissions on their Instagram accounts, in order to showcase a variety of different looks . Lookalike: After being scouted on Instagram, model Gabi Konopko was quickly catapulted to stardom, with many commented on her similarities with fellow IMG model Lara Stone . It is hoped that the idea of a social media model search might one day become a widely-accepted means of finding new talent - not least because it saves the agencies from having to send their scouts abroad in order to meet with potential models. 'We've been scouting via social for a while now and have developed proprietary methods to help us identify the best possible talent,' Ms Rose added. 'Those methods are now informing special tools we're building in-house that will help us move quickly and decisively while tracking thousands of accounts.' The We Love Your Genes Instagram account, which is run by Ms Rose and her colleagues, has now amassed nearly 12,000 followers - however thus far only a hand full of carefully-selected Instagram submissions have been chosen to feature on the account. Strike a pose: In some cases, the girls have gone back through their existing Instagram images in order to add the We Love Your Genes hashtag . Going global: Thus far IMG have received more than 14,000 submissions from around the world, including London, Sweden, Spain and America . The perfect pout: Chloe Logan captioned this image 'bonjour' before later adding the We Love Your Jeans tag . New IMG model Luna Sobrino is quoted on the account, which details her reaction to being scouted: 'I couldn't believe it! Literally not until I spoke to Jeni Rose on the phone I realized that I was given such amazing opportunity!” IMG are certainly not the first to turn to social media as a means of finding models - although this campaign is believed to be one of the biggest ever run. Both Marc Jacobs and Guess have held casting calls on Instagram in the past, with Marc Jacobs opting to use the social media platform in order to choose girls for both its Fall 2014 and Spring 2015 campaigns. 'It seemed like a great idea to me, as casting through Instagram seemed cool, current and strong,' Jacobs told WWD after his fall campaign was unveiled. 'We wanted the ads to shout with youth and energy...to be fresh and reclaim the spirit that the collection had when we first conceived of it - to be another collection, not a second line.' Multi-talented: IMG praised model Gizele Oliveira for her ability to pull of any look . Globe trotter: The 21-year-old Brazilian was flown out to New York to meet with IMG scouts and now lives and works in the Big Apple . Pretty and petite: Mies Magrijn was convinced that she was too short to ever be taken seriously as a model ."

         "As Prince Andrew tries to salvage his scandal-hit reputation in the 'sex slave' case - the man who knows all of his pedophile pal Jeffrey Epstein's secrets has died before he could tell all in an upcoming court battle. Alfredo Rodriguez, who was Epstein's houseman for many years, passed away last week after a six-month battle with cancer, his widow Patricia Dunn told DailyMail.com. 'Of course he knew all about Prince Andrew,' Dunn said on the doorstep of the home she shared with Alfredo in southwest Miami. Buried secrets: Alfredo Rodriguez, who was Epstein's houseman for many years, passed away last week after a six-month battle with cancer, his widow Patricia Dunn told DailyMail.com. He carried many secrets of Epstein's scandalous activities to his grave . Cold comfort: Prince Andrew (right) has become embroiled in the scandal as new court papers claim Epstein (left) supplied him with underage women for sex. He says he found Epstein's friendship comforting . Home sweet home: Rodriguez saw a lot when he worked at Epstein's Palm Beach mansion . 'We weren't expecting the case to come back into the news again,' she added. DailyMail.com revealed that Rodriguez kept a black book of Epstein's contacts — which he referred to as 'The Holy Grail.' or 'Golden Nugget.' The dozens of entries included contact details for A-list names including former President Bill Clinton, Mick Jagger, Donald Trump, Earl Spencer, Barbara Walters, Henry Kissinger and at least three members of the Kennedy clan. Court papers state that Rodriguez argued that he needed to keep the journal as insurance — as he feared Epstein would make him 'disappear'. Court papers also reveal that Rodriguez witnessed nude girls whom he believed were underage at the pool area of the home and knew that his former employer was engaging in sexual contact with underage girls and had viewed pornographic images of underage girls on his home computers. The sensational case has blown up again following court papers filed by two women last week. In them, Andrew, Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz — a key member of O.J. Simpson's legal dream team — and French modeling scout Jean Luc Brunel were accused of taking advantage of the girls when they were under 18. Rodriguez kept a detailed 'black book' of dozens of young women that Epstein abused. The houseman was sentenced to 18 months jail — the same term as his boss — in 2011 for failing to hand the journal to prosecutors. Instead he tried to sell it to defense lawyers for $50,000. The book 'detailed the full scope and the extent of Epstein's involvement with underage girls,' said lawyers. The book also had extensive contact details for Epstein's celebrity friends who included former President Bill Clinton, actors Kevin Spacey and Chris Rock and Celebrity Apprentice host, property mogul Donald Trump. Dunn, a real estate agent, told DailyMail.com that she did not personally know the details and had never met any of the men. 'But I heard a lot of stories,' she added. 'It was a terrible case and Alfredo wasn't really involved' she added. Rodriguez, who was 60, died on December 28 of mesothelioma. On her Facebook page, his Bolivian-born wife wrote in Spanish: 'Though our lives were together for 21 years, the last six months (since I learned of your illness) were a rollercoaster of emotions, feelings and harsh experiences. 'I learned again to love, to appreciate you, to meet you again, and have patience, which is something I did not know and I learned with pleasure.' Stories: Rodriguez' wife, a real estate agent, told DailyMail.com that she did not personally know the details and had never met any of the men involved with Epstein. 'But I heard a lot of stories,' she added . Rodriguez took Epstein's book without disclosing it to prosecutors, who claim that if they had known of it at the time of Epstein's court case he would have received a much stiffer sentence. But rather than the details of what was in the book, it is what Rodriguez witnessed that could have confirmed whether Prince Andrew had indeed abused the teens. Court papers say Rodriguez 'saw numerous underage girls coming into Epstein’s mansion for purported \"massages\".' A detailed 2007 account of the Epstein case published in New York magazine claimed one of Rodriguez's duties was to wash sex toys that he would find scattered on the floor of Epstein's many houses. Never-married Epstein, 61, was a physics and calculus teacher at the private Dalton School in New York in 1976 when he caught the eye of one of his student's fathers who offered him a job as an options trader with the investment bank Bear Stearns. He later founded his own wealth management company, becoming hugely wealthy in the process. He is said to own the largest private residence in New York along with the private 78-acre Little St. James Island in the Virgin Islands, a mansion in Palm Beach, Florida, a huge ranch in New Mexico and properties in London and Paris. One of the Jane Doe's claimed Epstein forced her to have sex with Harvard lawyer Alan Dershowitz . He has helped fund many science research projects and is a firm believer in the power of massage — he gave $100,000 to Ballet Florida to allow dancers to have daily rubdowns. But his reputation came crashing down in 2007 when the sordid details of his penchant for young girls was laid bare in a sensational court case. In the end he was sentenced to 18 months in jail on a single charge of soliciting an under-age girl for prostitution. He is now a registered sex offender. He had known Andrew for years — they vacationed together in Thailand and the prince even stayed at his New York mansion after Epstein had completed 13 months of his 18-month jail sentence. According to Vanity Fair, Andrew liked Epstein because he taught him how to relax. When the prince was warned by an advisor after the court case that he should distance himself from Epstein, Andrew allegedly screamed: 'Leave me alone. Jeffrey’s my friend. Being loyal to your friends is a virtue. And I’m going to be loyal to him.’ The women who recently joined the lawsuit against Epstein were referred to in court papers as Jane Doe #3 and Jane Doe #4. Jane Doe #3, who makes the claims about Prince Andrew, Dershowitz and Brunel, has since been identified as blonde Virginia Roberts, now 30. The two women joined a lawsuit filed by two other women, Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2. All four claim they were enticed into giving sexually explicit nude massages to Epstein when they were under age. Jane Doe #3 — Roberts — says Epstein forced her to have sex with Andrew, Dershowitz and Brunel. She says Epstein knew Andrew through their mutual friendship with Ghislaine Maxwell, the daughter of the late crooked publisher Robert Maxwell. 'Perhaps even more important to her role in Epstein's sexual abuse ring, Maxwell had direct connections to other powerful individuals with whom she could connect Epstein,' the suit says. 'For instance, one such powerful individual Epstein forced Jane Doe #3 to have sexual relations with was a member of the British Royal Family, Prince Andrew (a/k/a Duke of York). 'Jane Doe #3 was forced to have sexual relations with this Prince when she was a minor in three separate geographical locations: in London (at Ghislaine Maxwell's apartment), in New York, and on Epstein's private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands (in an orgy with numerous other under-aged girls),' the suit continues. Off duty: A detailed 2007 account of the Epstein case claimed one of Rodriguez's duties was to wash sex toys that he would find scattered on the floor of Epstein's many houses . The papers, prepared by lawyers Bradley Edwards and Paul Cassell, also claim Epstein 'trafficked Jane Doe #3 for sexual purposes to many other powerful men, including numerous prominent American politicians, powerful business executives, foreign presidents, a well-known Prime Minister, and other world leaders. 'Epstein required Jane Doe #3 to describe the events that she had with these men so that he could potentially blackmail them,' say the attorneys . 'Epstein instructed Jane Doe #3 that she was to give the Prince whatever he demanded and required Jane Doe #3 to report back to him on the details of the sexual abuse. Maxwell facilitated Prince Andrew's acts of sexual abuse by acting as a \"madame\" for Epstein, thereby assisting in internationally trafficking Jane Doe #3 (and numerous other young girls) for sexual purposes.' Andrew was photographed with his arm around Roberts in 2001, with Ghislaine Maxwell standing next to them. Both Andrew and Dershowitz have strenuously denied the allegations and Rodriguez, who went to jail for refusing to hand over a book of Epstein's sexual escapades to prosecutors, could have shed more light on whether the two men were really involved.

         "Warrington gatecrashed the party of their arch rivals with a 39-12 victory at Langtree Park to keep St Helens waiting for their first trophy for six years. Saints needed only a point to ensure they would finish top of the First Utility Super League for the first time since 2008 but the League Leaders' Shield was put back in its case after the Wolves ran in seven tries, two of them from the league's leading scorer Joel Monaghan, to ruin their big night. St Helens will still get their hands on the shield if Castleford lose at home to Wakefield on Sunday, otherwise they will have another chance to clinch it with a win at coach Nathan Brown's former club Huddersfield in their final league game next Friday. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Warrington Wolves' epic 2015 season ticket promo #areyouin . Joy and misery: St Helens lost 39-12 to Warrington, meaning they could not claim the league leaders' trophy . Warrington's emphatic victory, which was sweet revenge for their opening-day 38-8 home defeat back in February and lifts them up to second place, came despite a spate of injuries, most seriously to loose forward Simon Grix, who was carried off on a stretcher with a suspected broken ankle just 17 minutes into the match. The Wolves also lost co-captains Michael Monaghan and Ben Westwood before half-time, although the former was able to return in the second half, while St Helens lost full-back Shannon McDonnell with a facial injury at half-time. Saints were a shadow of the team that won at Leeds last Friday yet they made a dream start when skipper Paul Wellens passed out of the tackle and forward Anthony Laffranchi's inside ball got McDonnell over for his third try in as many games for the club with just three minutes on the clock. Tom Makinson's goal made it 6-0 but the Wolves struck back four minutes later when Stefan Ratchford, restored to the side at right centre, dummied his way over for their first try. The visitors then established a vice-like grip on the game with the aid of three penalties and three goal-line drop-outs, largely the result of the fine kicking game of half-backs Richie Myler and Gareth O'Brien. The visitors shrugged off the loss of Grix to go in front when Michael Monaghan dummied his way over from acting half-back before providing the spark for a long-range try for brother Joel. Celebration: Warrington Wolves players gather in the corner after scoring a try against St Helens on Thursday . The hooker put second rower Trent Waterhouse through a gap deep inside his own half and Myler took play on before sending Monaghan the winger over for a glorious score. When O'Brien dummied his way over on 24 minutes for his side's third try in seven minutes and Ratchford kicked his third goal, there seemed no way back for Saints. But when Michael Monaghan was withdrawn on 26 minutes after taking a heavy knock and Westwood limped off four minutes later, the game took a twist. Saints received their first penalty after half an hour, to ironic cheers from the crowd, and immediately grabbed their second try, with substitute Willie Manu taking Wellens' clever pass and wrong-footing full-back Matty Russell. Makinson's second goal cut the deficit to 22-12 but Saints could not cut out the errors and paid the price. Myler added a drop goal on the stroke of half-time and Warrington increased their lead further six minutes into the second half when Myler took Micky Higham's pass to dummy his way over for their fifth try. Saints' miserable night was summed up on 52 minutes when prop Mose Masoe fumbled the ball 30 metres from his own line and Warrington centre Ryan Atkins kicked ahead on the resulting free play for Joel Monaghan to grab his second try, his 26th of the campaign. Ratchford took his goal tally to four and Atkins added a seventh try on 63 minutes after swooping on a wayward Saints pass inside their own half."

         "Arsenal striker Lukas Podolski has shot down reports that he is being lined up for a £10million move to bitter rivals Tottenham. The World Cup winner posted a message on his Twitter account, saying: 'Hell would freeze over before this transfer would happen #Poldi #aha #AlwaysAGunner #Nevercheatyourclub #afc #RedArmy'. Reports suggest the Germany forward has grown frustrated at his lack of playing time - with Arsene Wenger yet to start him in the Premier League this season, preferring Alexis Sanchez and Danny Welbeck. Lukas Podolski has swiftly nipped rumours of a move from Arsenal to Tottenham in the bud . The World Cup winner made it clear in no uncertain terms that he wouldn't be leaving for White Hart Lane . The fact the 29-year-old has been unable to force his way in even though Arsenal have also been without long-term absentees Theo Walcott and Olivier Giroud has led to uncertainty over his future. Speaking after winning his 120th cap for Germany in the 1-1 draw with the Republic of Ireland, Podolski said: 'I have assessed my position in the team, and it has to change now. 'Let's see what happens in the winter. The fact is that I'm not happy with it, that's clear.' What is also clear is that, should the former Cologne forward decide to leave the club, he will not be moving across north London to White Hart Lane. Podolski arrived at the Emirates for £11m in 2012 and has scored 28 goals from 74 appearances - with 20 of those coming from the bench. Podolski, training with Danny Welbeck (right), admits he has been frustrated by his lack of playing time . The Germany forward has scored 20 of his 28 goals for the club from the substitutes bench ."

Earlier this year, Talia also fulfilled her dream of becoming a fashion designer as she collaborated on a line of clothing for teenagers called That Bald Chick with Los Angeles-based designer, Urbana Chappa. Ms Chappa, who runs a womenswear label called Maison De Urbana, got in touch with Talia after hearing her inspirational story on the Ellen show last fall. She flew to Florida on April 15 to meet the teen at the Arnold Palmer Hospital for Children in Orlando and help bring her design ideas to life.

Controversial footballer Joey Barton has exposed himself to ridicule by conducting an interview in English with a bizarre French accent. Barton, 30, spoke for more than a minute in an accent reminiscent of 'Allo 'Allo! after making his loan league debut for Olympique de Marseille against Lille. And he also insulted his host country by describing, in Franglais, French football as 'boring', saying: 'Maybe the one criticism of the French Ligue is it's a leetle bit boring'. The QPR midfielder's toe-curling display did little to substantiate his previous claim that he was 'too intelligent to be a footballer'. Scroll down for video . Gaffe: Joey Barton spoke in a French accent at the press conference after his league debut for Marseille . Seriously? Barton made a similar gaffe to former England manager Steve McClaren when he spoke in a faux Dutch accent . All smiles: Barton joked with the French media in the press conference . VIDEO: WATCH JOEY BARTON'S HILARIOUS FRENCH ACCENT . In the accented interview Barton said: 'For me it's important that people speak about the qualities I bring as a footballer.' Barton's embarrassing display evoked memories of both 'Allo 'Allo!'s Officer Crabtree, and, in real life, the hilarious interview former England boss Steve McClaren gave in 2008 when he spoke English in a Dutch accent when managing Dutch side FC Twente. Barton, who earns around £3m a year, seemed aware of the comparison . between his performance and the popular 'Allo 'Allo . character - as well as McClaren. Following the interview, Barton tweeted: 'Steve MaClaren (sic) eat your heart out...' 'In my defence, it is very difficult to do a . press conference in Scouse for a room full of French journalists. The . alternative is to speak...like a 'Allo Allo!' character which is choose . Its simply a case of you had to be there. #youstupidwomen!' Applause: Barton is on loan to the French team from British side QPR . A few hours later he decided to up the intellectual tone by tweeting a quote from the German philosopher Nietzsche. He also came up with a novel name for the language, and said: 'I am christening this new language Bartonese...' Speaking in France before his league . debut, Barton said: 'Perhaps I shouldn't say it, but I'm maybe a little . too intelligent to be a footballer.' Oh 'Allo! Barton sounded alarmingly like Officer Crabtree from the hit television series . The claims in a French newspaper attracted derision from former Arsenal and Manchester United player Mikael Silvestre. On Twitter, he wrote: 'The uneducated Joey Barton is fascinating for the degree of his stupidity, his ego and his megalomania!' Barton helped his side beat Lille 1-0 in the match at the Stade Velodrome on Sunday. Well cast: Here's what Joey would look like if he was in the 80s sitcom (and below) in a couple of online virals .

         "By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Ukip faced fresh accusations of double standards today amid claims Eastern Europeans have been hired to hand out flyers in its anti-immigration election campaign. Latvians have been hired by a firm in Croydon to hand out flyers ahead of elections on May 22. It follows revelations the party used an Irish actor in a poster about Brits missing out on jobs, as David Cameron today stepped up his attack on Ukip, accusing his rivals of not believing the country has a bright future. Ukip leader Nigel Farage has used a £1.5million poster campaign to take on the bigger parties ahead of local council and Euro elections on May 22 . Ukip faced embarrassment after it emerged the builder in its latest anti-immigration advert was an actor, Dave O'Rourke, who is from Ireland . Ukip has launched a £1.5million publicity drive in the hope of triggering a 'political earthquake' by topping the Euro poll on May 22. But the campaign attacking 'open doors' immigration from the EU has been dogged by allegations of spin, fakery and hypocrisy. Today it emerged that Ukip flyers were being delivered by Eastern Europeans hired by company Fast Leaflet in Croydon. Boss Andrew Spalis told the Huffington Post many of his employees are from Latvia and 'only yesterday' had been working for Ukip. Tory MP Gavin Barwell said: 'Ukip’s hypocrisy knows no bounds. They say they are against Europeans taking our jobs and then, when they have a chance to offer some British people work delivering their leaflets because they can’t find volunteers to do it, they employ European workers.' The row comes after it emerged that one of the stars of a Ukip poster campaign, who appeared to be a British builder ‘hit hard by unlimited cheap labour’, was actually an Irish actor, Dave O’Rourke. Today Ukip launched an investigation into a tweet from a party account boasting about its 'indigenous, white candidate' in the Newark by-election, Roger Helmer, who today gave an interview stressing he was now more relaxed about gay people. David Cameron took another swipe at Ukip during Prime Minister's Questions in the Commons today . Ukip has urged to 18 per cent in the latest Survation poll for the Mirror, with the Tories just one point behind Labour. The Conservatives have been torn between attacking Ukip and trying to woo its supporters. But today in the Commons, Mr Cameron accused Ukip of having a negative outlook about the future. Speaking during Prime Minister's Questions, he said: 'Britain has benefited from being an economy that is open to investment and open to people coming who want to contribute and work hard here. 'So much of their view seems to be that we don't have a bright future in this country. 'I absolutely believe that we do, if we get our deficit down, we get our economy growing, we invest in apprenticeships, we show that we can be one of the success stories of the 21st Century. We're making progress and that is the way to challenge their world view.' Ukip has made gains in the polls after stepping up its attacks on immigration and the EU. Yesterday the party confirmed its controversial MEP Roger Helmer will fight the upcoming Newark by-election for the party - despite recent controversy over a series of remarks about homosexuality. The party's local Twitter account - UKIP Newark - tweeted soon after: Newark: Our indiginous white candidate is ready to rock and roll #LetsDoThis.' Party aides inititally suggested the account was not official, but later it posted another message stating: 'Several members have access to this account. Tweet deleted. Investigation begun.' Soon after Roger Helmer was named as Ukip's candidate in the Newark by-electon, the Twitter account UKIPNewark posted this controversial comment . Amid confusion about whether the account was official, this message appeared hours later . Mr Helmer sparked outrage in 2012 after likening gay marriage to incest. The 70-year-old has also claimed people should be able to prefer being straight to being gay - like some people prefer Earl Grey to ordinary tea. And in 2000 he said being gay is ‘not worthy of valid equal respect’. But in an interview with The Times today he said he had relaxed his views, but appeared to suggest gay people are more likely to have threesomes. Mr Helmer said: 'I was raised in a very traditional home and I guess I grew up with those attitudes, but hell, we are now in the 21st century and my position is exactly the same as the party's position: that we are a broadly libertarian party and what two consenting adults, or indeed more than two consenting adults, choose to do together is none of my business, none of the party's business and as far as we're concerned, they're free to get on with it.' Roger Helmer has rarely avoided controversy during his career as an MEP, but has been returned to Brussels three times . Mr Helmer's selection comes after Ukip leader Nigel Farage ducked the chance to fight the Nottinghamshire seat. The byelection was called after the disgraced former Tory MP Patrick Mercer resigned in the wake of a cash-for-questions scandal. Mr Helmer was elected to the European Parliament in 1999 as the Tory MEP for the East Midlands - and re-elected in 2004 and 2009 - before defecting to Ukip in March 2012. His outspoken views have caused controversy throughout his career and last year even Mr Farage said he had gone 'too far' with his attack on gay marriage. In 2012 Mr Helmer said: 'If two men have a right to marry, how can we deny the same right to two siblings? Are we to authorise incest?' His made the bombshell remarks in a pamphlet entitled 'Straight Talking on Europe'. Nigel Farage decided not to fight the Newark by-election - leaving himself open to accusations that he 'bottled' his big chance . The year before he asked: 'Why is it OK for a surgeon to perform a sex-change operation, but not OK for a psychiatrist to try to \"turn\" a consenting homosexual?' Mr Helmer has also dismissed homophobia as a 'weasel word'. He said: 'The homosexual lobby is not content with decriminalisation. It wants to be accepted as a \"valid alternative lifestyle\". 'But it is not a valid lifestyle worthy of equal respect. 'At the risk of offending the politically correct, I will argue that homosexual behaviour is abnormal and undesirable.' He previously questioned the existence of 'homophobia', saying some people found gay relationships 'distasteful if not viscerally repugnant'. He defended the remarks, saying: 'Different people have different tastes. You may tell me you don't like Earl Grey tea. That may be a minority view but you are entitled not to like it if you don't like it. The Ukip candidate added: 'I simply made the point that people were entitled to their personal preferences. 'It is morally acceptable to prefer heterosexuality over homosexuality, or vice versa. Most of us prefer one or the other.' He later added: 'I said that people may prefer heterosexuality or homosexuality. I did not say that people could dislike – much less hate – other people on the grounds of their sexual orientation. 'The mainstream media are engaged in a feeding frenzy against Ukip, and are prepared to twist the facts to suit their agenda.' Mr Helmer also insists that he has condemned homophobia during his career. He said 'prejudice, hostility and violence against homosexuals are wrong and totally unacceptable'. But Mr Helmer's controversial views are not restricted to homosexuality. He has claimed that women who are date raped must ‘share part of the responsibility’. Mr Helmer said in 'stranger rape' the blame was 'squarely on the perpetrator' but in date rape cases 'the victim surely shares a part of the responsibility, if only for establishing reasonable expectations in her boyfriend’s mind'. The outspoken MEP has also claimed the Catholic Church was ‘systematically paedophilic’. He said: ‘So far as I know it has no rules or systems designed to support or promote paedophilia. 'But I think it would be perfectly fair to describe it as systemically paedophile.’ Despite Mr Helmer's controversial past, he was 'overwhelmingly' endorsed by the Newark constituency association at a hustings meeting on Monday before being backed by Ukip's National Executive Committee, a party spokesman said. Mr Helmer said: 'I am both proud and humbled to have been selected by the constituency association in Newark to represent the UKIP cause in this historic town in what could well prove to be an historic by-election.' 'It would be a huge honour to be elected to serve as Newark’s MP and I will be giving my all over the next few weeks to achieve that outcome.' Mr Farage said: 'He is a massively experienced and respected figure on the national political stage and on the local political stage as well. 'I know that the Ukip membership will rally to the cause of making Roger our first directly elected MP.' The Newark by-election is scheduled to take place on June 5, with the Conservatives selecting Robert Jenrick to run and Labour represented by Michael Payne. The Lib Dems are expected to choose a candidate in the coming days."

         "Oh, how celebrities love Twitter. They can pour out whatever drivel they please without interruption. But best of all, for them at least, they can get paid for their ‘thoughts’ on the social networking site. A sting on soap stars in Manchester, which was revealed this week, has shown just how commercial celebrity tweets have become. Actors from Coronation Street were invited to a ‘gifting event’ at a Manchester Hotel and then wrote glowing tweets about freebie goodies they’d been given by a fake company called Puttanta Aziendale (amusingly, in Italian that means ‘corporate whore’). Sponsored: Actress Amanda Holden (left) and singer Alesha Dixon (right) have both been seen to plug their sponsors on Twitter . They may have claimed they were tricked into writing the tweets, but the investigation has highlighted a growing grey area where celebrities are using Twitter for their own gain. In the U.S., stars such as Kim Kardashian — who has 18 million followers on Twitter — can earn up to £7,000 for a single 140-character tweet if she mentions a particular product. Here, footballer Wayne Rooney was rapped by the advertising watchdog the ASA for posting links written by his Nike sponsors. The ASA deemed the tweets to be more like adverts — but that doesn’t appear to have stopped more recent tweets about Rooney’s new Nike golf club, for example. Others are more subtle when it comes to their commercial tweets, whether it is a TV presenter talking about the wonderful designer clothes she has been given or the sports star who tweets about her new car, but fails to mention it came courtesy of her sponsor. What’s becoming increasingly clear is that Twitter — once a forum for celebrities to express their real feelings — is increasingly becoming a business. The biggest stars can earn up to £100,000 a year (in ready cash or the equivalent in freebies) simply for telling their followers their sponsored ‘thoughts’. Here, the Mail looks at some of the worst offenders. Tweeter: Elizabeth Hurley has been known to subtly mention Estee Lauder - without giving away the fact she is paid thousands by them each year for promotional work . ELIZABETH HURLEY . Engaged to Aussie cricketer Shane Warne, the self-styled ‘mum, model, actress, bikini designer, organic farmer’ is worth £7 million and has 300,000 followers. WHAT SHE TWEETS ABOUT: In between flirting with her fiancé via Twitter and endless plugs about her bikini and bedding ranges, and acting work, Elizabeth also finds time to subtly mention Estee Lauder — without giving away the fact she is paid thousands by them each year for promotional work. In May, she wrote ‘salivating over my new @Estee Lauder goodies’ and a day later: ‘And thank you @Estee Lauder for the arsenal of lip goodies.’ SHAMELESS PLUGGING: 6/10 VICTORIA BECKHAM . The Spice Girl turned fashion designer, 39, has 6.3 million followers — and is worth a cool £40 million. WHAT SHE TWEETS ABOUT: There is a lot about her jet-setting and clothing line, and plenty about how handsome her husband is, but she still manages to fit in a few plugs for some of the many items she gets free or hugely discounted. These include Chloe slippers: ‘How cute are these!!!’; white designer shoes: ‘Obsessed with my new white @ManoloBlahniks’; more shoes: ‘Thank you @Prada for my shoes!!! How posh, they have my initials on!!!’ And there is other designer gear which is all pictured: ‘Nicest socks ever! Comme de Garcons’; ‘Manolo Blahnik candles!!! Super chic.’ And even stuff for her 23-month-old fashion plate daughter (and favourite accessory) Harper: ‘Super cute jelly shoes for Harper from Vivienne Westwood @FollowWestwood.’ SHAMELESS PLUGGING: 9/10 . Stars: Kim Kardashian (left) can earn up to £7,000 for a single 140-character tweet if she mentions a particular product while Justin Bieber (right) has a serious amount of 'Beliebers' who hang on his every word . KIM KARDASHIAN . The curvy 32-year-old American reality star, aka ‘the world’s worst role model’, recently gave birth to a daughter called North West (yes, really). She’s reportedly worth £14 million and has 18 million Twitter followers. WHAT SHE TWEETS ABOUT: There is a lot about the Kardashians’ huge ‘Kollection’ of wares; just about anything from clothes to bronzing lotion. Everyone, it seems, wants to get that Kardashian look and she is there to help you — by plugging the stuff she is given. If you want to be as sparkly as her, you could try ‘Necklace sparkling on my face #LoveDannijoJewellery,’; if you want her decorative look, there is ‘chic @lampsplus lighting’; or if you have sore lips ‘@EOS to the rescue!’ It goes on. SHAMELESS PLUGGING: 10/10 . Glamour-model: Katie Price tweets about companies who pay her - such as the chocolate bar Snickers - or give her free stuff . JUSTIN BIEBER . The Canadian singer is beloved by obsessed teenagers around the world — which is why 41 million follow the 19-year-old on Twitter. WHAT HE TWEETS ABOUT: Justin has a serious amount of ‘Beliebers’ who hang on his every word. A lot of his tweets are about his day-to-day activities as he tours the world. But there are several plugs for sponsor Adidas, such as ‘Shooting with @adidasNEOLabel today. Making them make longer shirts’. Another was for his range of telephone cases made by Cellairis: ‘u got one?’ he asks. He doesn’t forget his tour sponsor: ‘Shoutout to @essence_US cosmetics. They’ll give away tix for my shows in the U.S. & Canada PLUS meet & greets!’ Be still, beating hearts. SHAMELESS PLUGGING: 8/10 . ALESHA DIXON . The pregnant 34-year-old singer- turned-reality show judge (below) is worth £4 million and has amassed 600,000 Twitter followers. WHAT SHE TWEETS ABOUT: Alesha started the year with a resolution to get fit. ‘First training session this year done! Was hard but feel good! Going 2 stick 2 my resolution and fight the January blues @LAfitnessUK_HQ X.’ Did she need to tell us what gym it was? Surely it’s not because she has a commercial interest, is it? Well, what do you know — she’s the company’s creative director. Alesha’s other big sponsor is Avon: ‘Well done @AvonUK for reaching 50k followers. Mwah!’ she tweeted. Again no mention is made of the fact she is being paid by them. SHAMELESS PLUGGING: 7/10 . Tweets: Katie Price and Alesha Dixon have both been seen plugging their sponsors . KATIE PRICE . The 34-year-old glamour model turned author, clothes designer, columnist and businesswoman says on Twitter: ‘Never underestimate the Pricey!’ She may have a point, given that she has a reported fortune of £45 million and 1.8 million Twitter followers. WHAT SHE TWEETS ABOUT: In between spreading the word about her many activities, Katie is busy tweeting about companies who pay her — such as the chocolate bar Snickers — or give her free stuff. In the past few days, there have been plugs for card and gift company Clintons, ‘for the amazing bag of goodies’, fashion retailer Spoiled Brat, a ‘Ferrari engine’ hairdrier and a Somerset hotel: ‘I also used @therookerymanor spa for a girlie day out, great for hen do to relax enjoy time with friends/family’. SHAMELESS PLUGGING: 10/10 . Celebrities: Amanda Holden has tweeted about J'aton Couture while Wayne Rooney tweeted about his sponsor Nike . AMANDA HOLDEN . The outspoken 42-year-old actress and Britain’s Got Talent judge (above) has 1.4 million followers. WHAT SHE TWEETS ABOUT: It isn’t easy looking good on screen, so she tweets thanks for the help she gets. All her clothes for BGT come from Australian clothes designer J’Aton at a hugely discounted price and were regularly plugged on her Twitter feed: ‘OMG!!! Just taken delivery of my first batch of dresses from J’Aton Couture!!! For BGT live!!! Beyond excited.’ There were also plugs for shoe shop Love Lemonade and manicure company nailbanguk. SHAMELESS PLUGGING: 6/10 . The 27-year-old England and Manchester United footballer is worth £50 million and has 6.6 million followers on Twitter. WHAT HE TWEETS ABOUT: Wayne may have been censured by the advertising watchdog for his link to Nike, but that has not stopped him tweeting about the company — without mentioning his £1 million-a-year deal with them. Recent examples include: ‘The pitches change. The killer instinct doesn’t. Own the turf, anywhere @NikeFootball’ and ‘Different rules, same philosophy: play your way’ with another Nike link. Who knew he had such a way with words? In March, he plugged another Nike freebie: ‘Just got my @NikeGoldEU Covert driver. Can’t wait to get out and test it,’ he wrote of a new golf club. Wayne is also ‘lead global ambassador in football’ for U.S. firm Five Star Training. ‘Enjoyed the drills day with Five Star Training,’ he wrote last month. ‘iPhone app in the works and coming in August, keep a look out!’ He is also sponsored by EA Sports, maker of the popular Fifa computer game. Perhaps that’s why he wrote: ‘Looking forward to my bed, but can’t sleep. Fifa time.’ SHAMELESS PLUGGING: 9/10 ."

         "Russia ordered surprise military exercises on Ukraine's doorstep Wednesday as tensions in that country's southern Crimea region simmered, with pro-Russian demonstrators facing off against rival protesters in the city of Simferopol. As the mood soured among the thousands rallying in front of the Crimean parliament building in Simferopol, some scuffles broke out. One group waved Ukrainian flags and shouted \"Crimea is not Russia,\" while the other held Russian flags aloft and shouted \"Crimea is Russia,\" images broadcast by Crimean TV channel ATR showed. As the crowd became more agitated, a line of police moved in to divide the groups. Local leaders sought to calm the mood, urging the protesters to go home and resist provocations. One man died around the time of the protests in front of Parliament, the Crimean Ministry of Health said on its website. The man had no visible signs of injury, and early indications point to a heart attack, it said. Seven people sought medical help. The demonstrations signal the broad divide between those who support what is going on in Kiev, where the new government is leaning toward the West, and those who back Russia's continued influence in Crimea and across Ukraine. In the capital Wednesday, the names of nominees for the country's new unity government were read to the crowd in Independence Square. Opposition leader Arseniy Yatsenyuk was named as a nominee for interim prime minister, while activist Dmytro Bulatov was put forward as sports minister. Candidates are expected to be voted on in Parliament Thursday. Russia's foreign minister has vowed not to intervene militarily in Ukraine. But with tensions in the region high, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered surprise military exercises. The exercises are \"to check combat readiness of armed forces in western and central military districts as well as several branches of the armed forces,\" Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu was quoted as saying by state media. Shoigu did not mention Ukraine, which lies to Russia's west, but the timing of the move has prompted speculation about the motivation. Ukraine's Ministry of Defense declined to comment on the exercises since they are on Russian territory. U.S. military intelligence has seen some Russian naval ship movement near Ukraine since the weekend, but it sees no immediate indication the Russians are preparing for any offensive military action in Ukraine, two U.S. officials said. Instead, the officials said intelligence suggests Russia is \"repositioning\" up to half a dozen Russian ships near the Ukrainian port city of Sevastapol in case they're needed to respond if Russian interests are threatened. \"They want to have their assets more accessible if needed,\" one official said. \"This will allow for an expedited response.\" Sevastapol is home to Russia's Black Sea fleet, so the ships could be used, if needed, to protect the base, Russian military assets and personnel, and Russian citizens around Sevastapol, the U.S. officials said. About 60% of the population in the city is Russian. The White House urged \"outside actors\" to respect Ukraine's sovereignty. \"We urge outside actors in the region to respect Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity and end provocative rhetoric and (take) actions to support democratically established transitional government structures and use their influence in support of unity, peace and an inclusive path forward,\" Deputy Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters. Russia held at least six snap combat readiness checks of its armed forces last year, the state-run RIA Novosti news agency said. 'Rumors' fuel fears of split . Concerns were heightened in the Crimea region when the Crimean Parliament convened a previously unscheduled session Wednesday, amid local media reports that secession might be on the agenda. But the Parliament speaker, Volodimir Konstantinov, denied there were plans to discuss \"radical issues\" such as the separation of Russia-oriented Crimea from Ukraine. In a statement on the Parliament website, he dismissed the local media reports as \"rumors,\" saying they were \"a provocation aimed at discrediting and de-legitimizing the Crimean parliament.\" He also urged the Crimean people to remain calm and not be provoked, the statement said. In Sevastopol, residents told CNN they were angry that President Viktor Yanukovych has been forced out and fear that they will be oppressed by the country's new leaders. Small pro-Russian protests were taking place in the Black Sea city Wednesday. A CNN team in the area encountered more than one pro-Russian militia checkpoint on the road from Sevastopol to Simferopol. Yanukovych's base of support is in eastern and southern Ukraine, where Russian culture and language predominate. In that region, most people are suspicious of the Europe-leaning views of their counterparts in western Ukraine, who were at the heart of the anti-government protests that filled central Kiev. Many are struggling to come to grips with the rapid political upheaval that has unfolded in Ukraine in recent days, after months of protests and last week's bloody clashes between protesters and security forces. Russia's Foreign Ministry has accused Ukraine's lawmakers of discriminating against ethnic Russians by excluding them from the reform process. Talks on new government . The tensions come as Ukraine's lawmakers scramble to put together a new unity government amid continued instability after Yanukovych's ouster. Vasil Gatsko, of the Ukrainian Democratic Alliance for Reforms (UDAR) party, said the newly formed government will be officially voted on in Ukraine's Parliament on Thursday morning. The interim authorities had initially hoped to announce a new government Tuesday. The names of the nominees for the new administration were read in Kiev's Independence Square, or Maidan -- which has been at the heart of the protest movement -- for approval from the crowds gathered there. The nominees were selected in a meeting Wednesday of the three main opposition parties and smaller parties. Bulatov, who was put forward as sports minister, spoke to CNN soon after the announcement. He is well-known as the activist who reappeared more than a week after he went missing amid anti-government protests, telling reporters he'd been kidnapped and tortured by his captors. \"People have to feel the changes, not to hear about them, but see them,\" he said. When asked what he saw as his biggest challenge as a possible minister, Bulatov replied: transparency. \"I think the first thing I must do is to bring more transparency,\" he said. \"It's gonna be the society, civil society I mean, who will be making decisions. The minister is a public person, and people must decide what is better, what are the priorities.\" Lawmakers face the challenge of forming a body that genuinely represents of all the main political parties, despite their widely divergent views, and includes technical experts and some of the people's heroes from the protests in Independence Square. Presidential and local elections are due to be held on May 25. One candidate has already been announced. Opposition leader and former heavyweight boxing champion Vitali Klitschko, of the UDAR party, will run for the presidency, his press secretary Oksana Zinovyeva said. 'We were trapped': Eyewitness to the massacre in Kiev . Elite riot police disbanded . Earlier Wednesday, acting Interior Minister Arsen Avakov announced that a riot police force used against anti-government protesters in Ukraine had been disbanded. Demonstrators accused the elite Berkut force, deployed by the government of Yanukovych to quell recent protests, of using excessive force. Avakov said on his Facebook page that he'd signed the order disbanding the force Tuesday. But the new, pro-Russian mayor of Sevastopol said Tuesday night at a rally in the city that he had secured funding to keep paying Berkut riot police there even after the force was disbanded. The mayor, Alexej Chaliy, was elected in an unofficial local vote, but the interim authorities in Kiev have said he is not a legitimate leader. Last week, the bloody street clashes between demonstrators and security forces left more than 80 dead, the deadliest violence in the country since it gained independence when the Soviet Union collapsed 22 years ago. Russia, which backed Yanukovych, contends that the President was driven out by an \"armed mutiny\" of extremists and terrorists. A warrant has been issued for his arrest, but his whereabouts remain unknown. Diplomatic moves . While Yanukovych is on the run, the diplomatic wheels have been set in motion within the international community. One key concern is Ukraine's perilous financial position. Interim Finance Minister Yury Kolobov proposed Monday that an international donor conference be held within two weeks. Ukraine, he said, will need $35 billion in foreign assistance by the end of 2015. Russia had offered Ukraine a $15 billion loan and cut in natural gas prices in November, but that deal seems unlikely to remain on the table if Ukraine turns toward Europe. UK Foreign Secretary William Hague tweeted Wednesday: \"Will discuss international financial support for #Ukraine at the IMF in Washington DC today.\" Ukrainian state news agency Ukrinform said the country has slashed its imports of natural gas from Russia in recent days. A U.S. State Department spokeswoman on Wednesday stressed that no decision has been made about financial assistance. \"The United States is continuing to consider a range of options, including loan guarantees, to support Ukraine economically. But no decision has been made, and the next step is the formation of a multiparty, technical government. \"Once that government is formed, we will begin to take immediate steps, in coordination with multilateral and bilateral partners, that could compliment an IMF package, to support Ukraine,\" said spokeswoman Jen Psaki. Speaking in Washington on Tuesday, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said officials were \"deeply engaged in trying to help this extraordinary transition that is taking place in Ukraine.\" In a joint news conference with Hague, Kerry said that Ukraine's alliances should not necessarily determine what happens to its people -- and that it was not a \"zero sum\" game. \"It is not a Russia or the United States or other choices,\" he said. \"This is about people of Ukraine and Ukrainians making their choice about their future. And we want to work with Russia, with other countries, with everybody available to make sure this is peaceful from this day forward.\" Yanukovych's decision to scrap a European Union trade deal in favor of one with Russia prompted the protests, which began in November.

         "#madonnafall, #livingforlove",
         "This was the tumble that shook the internet, the fall that was bigger than the £5 million show itself, and quite possibly the ultimate wardrobe malfunction. After a 20-year absence from the Brit Awards, Madonna stooped to conquer — by falling off the stage. The extraordinary spectacle of the singer, worth £520 million, being thrown to the floor at the British music industry’s flagship award ceremony this week will surely go down as one of the most bizarre episodes in pop history. Scroll down for video . Madonna's a goner: The Material Girl doesn't shriek or grimace as she tumbles - and is there a trace of a wry smile on her lips? As she sang the lyrics from her new single, Living For Love, and reached the line, ‘Took me to heaven and let me fall down,’ she did indeed fall down — backwards down some steps, dragged by a backing singer tugging on her Armani cape. She was heard landing with a deep ‘thud’ by all sitting near the stage. For a moment, as the backing track continued to play, there was stillness and silence. And then the Material Girl, 56, rose, climbed the stairs again and resumed singing, completing her routine with remarkable aplomb. Sure, there was an extra kink in those Shirley Temple curls, and the vocals were not perfect, but, dignity aside, she seemed essentially none the worse for wear. And in getting up and embodying the ‘show must go on’ spirit, she was instantly lionised and hailed as an ‘icon’ by fans across the globe. Radio 1 breakfast DJ Nick Grimshaw, a barometer of cool, tweeted: ‘Madonna come party with us — I’m gonna DJ — you can vogue. Everything will be fine. DO NOT BRING THE BLOODY CAPE.’ Indeed, far from a disaster, the incident has provided a welcome burst of publicity. In its wake, not only has #madonnafall been trending worldwide (bringing her to the attention of the internet generation who have not, until now, been buying her music), but her single Living For Love has shot to the top of the iTunes chart from its previous position well outside the top 100, while the British Phonographic Industry reported yesterday that sales of her greatest hits album, Celebration, rocketed by 62 per cent. And despite presenters Ant and Dec joking after the show that they were sitting with the star in A&E, the performer herself is absolutely fine. Actually, and this may seem curious, Madonna made such a speedy recovery that she was well enough to plug her album, and pay thanks to her fashion designer friends, immediately after the show. 1. Madonna begins her performance, dressed as a matador and flanked by dancers . 2. Her cape is tugged backwards by a backing singer, but the star seems unperturbed . 3. As she starts to fall, a dancer is already vaulting to the floor. Was it all choreographed? 4. As she lands, dancers are waiting crouched around the back of the podium . ‘Armani hooked me up! My beautiful cape was tied too tight!’ she wrote on Instagram. ‘But nothing can stop me and love really lifted me up! Thanks for your good wishes! I’m fine! #livingforlove.’ It’s enough to make one suspect that perhaps, just perhaps, this was a publicity stunt. Conspiracy theorists were yesterday pointing out a few key peculiarities. First, close examination of the footage shows that just before she fell she wasn’t frantically trying to unclasp the cape — which, you imagine, you would surely do if you knew it was about to be whisked off. Instead she had her hands at her waist when she fell. Photographs also show the star looked peculiarly calm as she tumbled; no grimaces or shrieks. Indeed, in some images, traces of a smile seem to be playing about those tight features. Madonna revealed a bare behind on the red carpet at the Grammys earlier this month . Unlike her performance at the American music awards, the Grammys, earlier this month, where she wore a buttock-baring corset, Madonna also favoured a sensible pair of three-quarter length trousers — which will have made for a slightly more comfortable landing. Perish the thought they were padded. Might she, then, have planned it? After all, the perfectionist that she is, Madonna had spent two full days rehearsing her routine and performance at the O2. Surely someone as thorough as she would have finessed the business of taking a cape off. Intriguingly, at the very moment Madonna toppled from the raised stage, the male dancers flanking her vaulted down, too, and artfully formed into a ring around her. Viewed on video, they do not seem to be rushing to help her — their movements suggest a choreographed sequence. Those whose faces are not obscured by bizarre horned masks do not appear unduly concerned. What’s more, other dancers could be seen already crouching around the back of the podium before Madonna fell, almost as if they meant to catch her. And what is to be made of the lyrics of the song? As fans have noted, they seem to defy mere coincidence. ‘Took me to heaven and let me fall down, Now that it’s over, I’m gonna carry on,’ she sang. ‘Lifted me up, and watched me stumble, After the heartache, I’m gonna carry on.’ Showbusiness veteran Rick Sky, who has spent decades covering Madonna’s performances, said: ‘You would have thought it would be easier for Madonna to just show her a** for publicity — but she did that at the Grammy’s, didn’t she? Perhaps this was all that was left. Stranger things have happened. She is such a perfectionist that you know she will have rehearsed every last second of that performance, which makes it seem even more unlikely that it could be anything but deliberate.’ It is a view shared by hundreds of Twitter users. One wrote: ‘Who else thinks the Madonna fall was planned?’ Another: ‘I think it’s staged. It gets a lot of publicity and sympathy.’ Musician George Bowie tweeted: ‘The more I watch that video, the more I think it’s the greatest PR stunt of all time. New single out & everyone talking about Madonna.’ But if it was a stunt — albeit one that perhaps went slightly awry, with the singer hitting the floor more heavily than planned — what did Madonna hope to prove by it? Oops she did it again! Madonna's attention grabbing smooch with Britney Spears in 2003 . Madonna pictured under cover - for once - in a niqab last year . A flash of the old Madonna on stage in Turkey, also in 2014 . If nothing else, observers say the brief break in her vocals showed that she was not miming — an accusation she has faced in the past — although a fairly strong backing vocal could still be heard. Publicist Mark Borkowski tells me: ‘This was a massively important night for Madonna and she had her whole international team there. It was a huge event, her first time at the Brits in 20 years. She will not have wanted anything to go wrong. She is very exacting. There was a lot riding on this performance after Radio 1 was accused of not playing her single. She needs to convince the Taylor Swift generation to buy her music. That was what her performance there was all about.’ Madonna pictured arriving at Annabel's Private Members Club in London last night . For Madonna has been suffering from a brutal law of diminishing returns when it comes to recent album sales. Her last studio album MDNA in 2012 sold a relatively measly 1.8 million copies worldwide — even though she’d worked with the hottest young producers and embarked on a publicity blitz. You have to rewind ten years to 2005 to find her last big hit album, Confessions On A Dance Floor, which sold 12 million copies. The signs are that her new album Rebel Heart is going to continue the slide. No wonder she was so desperate for attention at the Grammys. It must be acknowledged, however, that Madonna is the mistress of the publicity stunt over a 32-year career. Often hailed as the queen of reinvention, she is ruthless when it comes to scheming her next shock. A brief history of her greatest stunts includes countless displays of vulgar provocation, from the release of her ‘coffee table’ Sex book in 1992 to wearing a niqab in 2014 and baring her breasts again for a magazine last year. Even in the Guy Ritchie years — when she tried to reinvent herself as the respectable wife of a film director — she didn’t stop, kissing Britney Spears on stage in 2003. As she has aged, she has sought to portray some of the attention-seeking as a bid to fight ageism — a sort of grey crusade with porn imagery thrown in. She said: ‘They’re judging me by my age. I don’t understand. But I don’t follow the rules. I never did, and I’m not going to start.’ As she says in this month’s Rolling Stone magazine: ‘My nature is to provoke, that’s true. I can’t help myself. But it’s always with good intentions.’ Her good intentions in London this week are probably best defined as intending to do herself some good. But the question is, was this the publicity addict’s most desperate stunt yet? Strictly no win no fee, of course! Beware: Possible publicity stunt ahead . All aboard the stairlift to the stars . Inspired by Michael Douglas's film ."

         "#UnAustralian, #NoRacism",
         "By . Daniel Piotrowski for Daily Mail Australia . The cafe owner who refused to give a barista a job because customers would not want 'coffee made by black people' appears to have closed his shop following a boycott. As first reported by the Daily Mail Australia, Steven Hu, the owner of the Forbes and Burton cafe in Darlinghurst in inner city Sydney, made the remarks more than a week ago to Brazilian-born Australian Nilson Dos Santos, 39. The cafe has since been the subject of a widespread customer boycott as well as egging and flour bomb attacks. The coffee shop was packed with lunchtime customers the day the owner denied Mr Do Santos a job on the basis of his skin colour. But there was no one inside the cornerside store on Tuesday morning. Scroll down for video . Empty: A lone pot plant sat the door the deserted Forbes and Burton cafe in Darlinghurst when the Daily Mail Australia visited on Tuesday. The racially-charged incident involving Brazillian-born barista Nilson Dos Santos, left, and cafe owner Steven Hu, right, has sparked international headlines. Deserted: There was no sign of life inside the inner-city cafe that was the scene of the alleged racist incident the Sunday before last. Pink chairs that served as part of the cafe's outdoor setting, lower left, have been moved inside. Closed for business: A pot plant sat on the front step of the once-bustling breakfast and lunch location this morning. Unintelligible grafitti was also scrawled across the concrete out the front. The lights were off, a lone pot plant sat on the doorstep and the cafe's outdoor setting had been stacked inside. Mr Hu told Daily Mail Australia: 'I won't say anything, sorry,' and hung up. Calls to the business's landline were not returned. The coffee shop's apparent closure comes after many customers pledged to take their business elsewhere. Stunned customers walked out of the store on the day of the incident after Mr Dos Santos announced what Mr Hu had said to him. In the days since many users have posted on the cafe's Facebook page committing to a boycott. One punter, Michelle Cavanagh, wrote: 'After what I've just read about a Brazilian barista being told he couldn't have a job because he was black don't expect me to ever Grace your doors.' One-time patron Sonia Cattley said she would no longer buy her coffee there. 'I have been a regular here on the way to work....you will now be seeing me pass with a coffee from another store in my hand...absolutely disgusted.' They were joined by Viet Anh, who remarked that there were many alternative cafes nearby. 'I say definitely all people should avoid this cafe because in Darlinghurst there are no shortage of cafes.' A popular meme has also been circulated saying 'Boycott Forbes and Burton... #UnAustralian #NoRacism'. Some customers said Mr Hu could rectify the situation with an apology, and perhaps a job offer. Rachel Frere said: 'Please offer the brazilian man the job and Ill come for a coffee.' Vincent Mok added: 'Mr Hu, would you retract your comments about Mr Dos Santos, hire him, be on good terms with him and others, sincerely apologise to the world and move on? It is never too late to say sorry.' The once-popular cafe appeared to have been egged at the weekend, according to these images that were posted on social media. 'Hope your shop burns down': One of many messages left on the cafe's Facebook wall as of Tuesday morning. No staff, customers or cafe owner Steven Hu, left, were present at the Forbes and Burton cafe in Darlinghurst when the Daily Mail Australia visited on Tuesday. Meanwhile, Mr Dos Santos said last week that he has received more than 20 job offers. Some comments crossed the line. 'Hope your cafe burns down,' said one recent post. While the cafe's fortunes have gone downhill, Mr Dos Santos was deluged with more than 20 job offers in the aftermath of the incident. He told Daily Mail Australia immediately following the incident: ‘I have never experienced anything like that in Australia,’ he said. ‘I love it here, I am free here, that’s why I chose to stay. I’ve always felt welcomed and accepted. For me, it was never a problem that I am black until today. Mr Hu admitted making the remarks at the time. 'There are a lot of white customers at the café and I think the clients here want local people, not African people,' he said at the time. 'We need to offer good service at this café and I think the coffee culture is more about white people. The Fair Work Ombudsman is continuing to investigate the matter. Local police said they had not received any complaints from the cafe's owner."

When officers posted along the street told the demonstrators that they were not allowed to be there, tempers flared and some of the marchers reportedly started pushing against NYPD barricades. One of the marchers was arrested after he allegedly flipped over a trash can. The station WNYW also reported that someone tossed an object from a building overlooking the parade path.

One group marched to Times Square, with police officers on their heels keeping tabs on the situation while avoiding confrontations.

Commissioner Bratton said that his officers were giving demonstrators 'breathing room' to air their grievances. . 'As long as they remain nonviolent, and as long as they don't engage in issues that cause fear or create vandalism, we will work with them to allow them to demonstrate,' he said."

Forty professional dancers, along with YouTube and Vine stars, came together for an epic fitness flash mob . Filmed on location in Logan, Utah, the dancers jogged in place on and off for over 12 hours during the shoot . Twelve YouTube and Vine stars were on hand to create the musical masterpiece, dancing along to the song The Str!ke by band Atom Bomb. Choreographed by Jason Celaya, it featured local dance teams like My Bad Crew, USU Dance Companies, Dance Factory, and USU Dance Club. Over the course of a grueling 12 hours, the 40 dancers jog-danced in high altitude - and, on occasion, on an incline - while being filmed on an Epic Red Dragon and 4k Sony f7 camera. The high-energy melody - a song called The Strike by Atom Bomb - provided the soundtrack . As part of NordicTrack's #makefunhappen campaign, the video was released and has since gone viral .

         "Rio Ferdinand says his friendship with Ashley Cole ended when he chose to side with John Terry in the race row with his younger brother Anton. Cole and Ferdinand had been pals since they were children, but that all ended when Cole defended Terry in court and the Chelsea skipper was subsequently cleared of racially abusing Anton Ferdinand during Chelsea's match with QPR in October 2011. Terry was found guilty by the FA 'using abusive and/or insulting words and/or behaviour'. You can like our Manchester United Facebook page here . VIDEO Scroll down to watch Rio Ferdinand: Finishing career with Harry Redknapp is a fairytale . Ashley Cole and Rio Ferdinand fell out during the court case between John Terry and Anton Ferdinand . But for Ferdinand the incident signalled the end of his friendship with Cole. Writing in his new autobiography, #2Sides, which is being serialised in The Sun, Ferdinand said: 'Our final communication was by text just before the trial at Westminster Magistrates Court. 'I told him he had a choice, \"You're my mate and you're John Terry's mate. You know both our families. So go into court and tell the exact truth about what happened, or don't go at all\". 'He told me, ''I've got no choice, I've been told I've got to go''. I said, \"Well, if you do go just know this: we will never talk again. You know what happened. You saw it\".' Rio Ferdinand, Ashley Cole and John Terry were all teammates for England for a number of years . Ferdinand was so angry with Cole, that he retweeted a comment on Twitter calling Cole a 'choc-ice' - black on the outside, white on the inside – a comment for which he was he was fined £45,000 by The FA. The former Manchester United defender expressed his regret at the situation and says it was a 'heat of the moment' action. Ashley Cole arrives to attend the trial of his team-mate John Terry at Westminster Magistrates court . The FA ruled that Anton Ferdinand (left) was called a 'f****** black c***' by John Terry in 2011 . Ferdinand says he still feels 'betrayed' by Cole for not telephoning him or Anton to explain his position. He added in his book: 'I think one day Ashley will realise he should've at least rung me. I would have respected that a lot more.' Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article."

         "The University of New Mexico says a psychology professor's tweet that people battling obesity don't have the willpower to finish a doctorate degree wasn't part of any research project as he had previously claimed. The school's institutional review board found that Geoffrey Miller's tweet was instead 'self-promotional'. Miller posted on Twitter last month that obese doctoral applicants who don't 'have the will power to stop eating carbs' won't 'have the willpower to do a dissertation'. Academic slip-up: Visiting NYU professor Geoffrey Miller caused outrage when he tweeted this message last month . The tweet has since been deleted and . his Twitter account been made private. Miller later apologized and said . the tweet was part of a research project. Miller is on leave from UNM while serving as a visiting professor at New York University. UNM officials say the school is conducting a disciplinary investigation. Geoffrey Miller, who specializes in evolutionary psychology, tweeted on June 2: 'Dear obese PhD applicants: If you don't . have the willpower to stop eating carbs, you won't have the willpower to . do a dissertation. #truth.' It is understood that he will keep his job as a visiting professor at NYU's Stern School of Business. Crass: The professor, who has tenure at the University of New Mexico, quickly apologized for his remarks . Professor Miller quickly deleted the message after a . backlash from students and professors alike. Jay Rosen, who teaches journalism at the New York school, wrote: 'Astonishing fat-shaming tweet, since deleted, from an academic, @matingmind. The mind boggles.' Miller's transgression brought into question the academic's impartiality when it came to picking students for highly competitive PhD programs. Dr Jason DeCaro, a former PhD student who is now a biological anthropologist in Alabama, tweeted: 'Dear rejected UNM psychology applicants: save now-deleted tweet for potential lawsuit. Jerk.' Miller posted a hasty apology: 'My sincere apologies to all for that idiotic, impulsive, and badly judged tweet. It does not reflect my true views, values, or standards.' Backlash: NYU journalism professor Jay Rosen criticized his colleague's actions . Outrage: Fellow academics and former PhD students including Dr Jason DeCaro in Alabama posted angry responses to Professor Miller . It was quickly followed by the . remark: 'Obviously my previous tweet does not represent the selection . policies of any university, or my own selection.' MailOnline received no response last month from Professor Miller as to what criteria he uses to select PhD students - and was awaiting a response on UNM's statement today. Miller, who is a tenured professor at the University of New Mexico, has joined NYU's Stern School of Business for eight months until this August. He has been published in a wide range of international academic publications and conducted research at the London School of Economics, the Max Planck Institute for Psychological Research in Munich, Germany and UCLA. All apologies: The academic quickly retracted his offensive remark on June 2 ."

         "By . Corey Charlton . Campaign groups are furious about a 'sexist' cartoon posted on a police Twitter account which shows a man gagging his wife with a seatbelt. The tweet, which shows a female car passenger gagged and bound to her chair as a male driver looks on smugly, was yesterday uploaded by a police officer. Above the cartoon a banner read: 'New Seatbelt design: 45% less car accidents!!' It was also captioned by the officer: 'A car designer has won an award for designing a seatbelt which helps to cut down on vehicle noise pollution #IWantOne.' The officer who tweeted the 'sexist' cartoon is now being investigated by the force's Professional Standards Department after it was found to have been in breach of the organisation's social media policy . West Midlands Police has now released a full statement apologising for 'any offence caused by this inappropriate use of one of our accounts'. The officer in question is also being investigated by the force’s Professional Standards Department. The incident provoked a barrage of complaints on the social networking site, with criticism from people based all over the UK and as far as Johannesburg in South Africa. Chief executive of national domestic violence charity Refuge, Sandra Horley CBE, criticised the force’s 'derogatory attitudes to women'. 'I am disappointed that West Midlands Police tweeted this sexist image - and then tried to pass it off as a bit of \"humour\". 'Did the police officer who tweeted this image really think that women would laugh at this offensive sexist stereotype? Female members of the public deserve respect, not ridicule. 'It is deeply disturbing that some police officers in West Midlands seem to possess such derogatory attitudes towards women.' Shabana Mahmood, Labour MP for Birmingham’s Ladywood constituency, added: 'The police are responsible for helping to hold to account those who perpetrate domestic violence. 'The fact that they have posted online a so-called joke which minimises the seriousness of this crime is both insulting and worrying. 'If individuals within the police force don’t understand that it is not a laughing matter and ensure that they take domestic violence seriously then who will?' Online campaign group End Misogyny confirmed the post will be appearing on its weekly updates of online sexist abuse. A spokesperson said: 'We see high volumes of misogyny and abuse here at End Online Misogyny and very often such comments, many of which promote domestic and sexual violence, are made under the guise of so-called humour. Bordesley Green police received a furious backlash on Twitter after the officer posted the cartoon - which was in clear breach of the force's social media policy . Inspector Karen Winfield, based at the nearby Stechford police station (pictured), said the cartoon which depicted the passenger in the car being gagged, was 'sexist and offensive' and in breach of police policy . 'It is however, extremely worrying to see a police account with nearly 1,000 followers... tweet out such an endorsement of violence against women.' Inspector Karen Winfield, from Birmingham Police, said: 'An officer working on one of our neighbourhood accounts has tweeted a sexist and offensive picture which clearly breaches the force’s social media policy. 'This was an inappropriate tweet, made by one member of staff, and it in no way reflects the views of the force. 'Social media can be an excellent way of communicating with local people and we trust our staff to tweet appropriately and sensibly, actively encouraging them to be engaging and friendly in their posts. 'However, occasionally mistakes are made and we apologise for any offence caused by this inappropriate use of one of our accounts.'"

         "The Ohio State Buckeyes made college football history on Monday as they stormed to National Championship victory over Oregon in the first College Football Playoff Championship - but in the adrenaline-pumped excitement managed to trample one of their own cheerleaders as they ran onto the field. A cheerleader, who was enthusiastically shaking her pom-poms, ended up face-down on the field as she tried to scramble out the way of the rushing players. The young woman had been carrying the 'O' flag to complete the waving banner for Ohio which also ended up being trampled into the field at Cowboy Stadium in Arlington, Texas. As she struggled to escape, one player then tripped over her, almost causing a domino-effect among the rushing team. The cheerleader was rescued by a teammate and was reportedly fine following the incident, watching the game from the sidelines. Some 80,000 screaming fans turned out to the stadium to watch the tense game which saw Ohio crush the University of Oregon with a 42-20 win - a surprising victory for the underdog team which sparked wild celebrations in Columbus with around 40 small fires lit in the streets and police forced to use pepper-spray on some of the thousands of revelers. Scroll down for video . Pushover: An Ohio State cheerleader was trampled by players from the team as they run onto the field ahead of the National Championships on Monday night in Arlington, Texas . Obstacle: As she hit the floor at Cowboy Stadium, the cheerleader immediately tried to get up (still clutching her pom-poms). However one of the players then tripped over her, causing a near disaster . Escape: In the end, one of her male teammates came to her rescue and pushed her away from the path of the team's tunnel. The young woman was reportedly fine following the incident and watched the game from the sidelines . The two teams were playing the first College Football Playoff championship in Arlington - and among those in the stands was basketball superstar (and Ohio State fan), LeBron James, who tweeted: 'On this bird celebrating a great night for OHIO!! THE Ohio State Buckeyes are National Champions!! #OH.' Ohio blew away the Ducks, beating them 42-20 with third-choice quarterback Cardale Jones. Oregon had been considered the favorite in part due to their star quarterback Marcus Mariota, who won the Heisman Trophy this season. Ohio State made it to the championship despite losing two talented quarterbacks to injuries this season and went into the game being very much seen as the underdogs. Ezekiel Elliott ran for 246 yards and four touchdowns for Ohio State, who become the first university to claim a national football title via a knock-out playoff competition. The national collegiate title has long been a coveted commodity in a sport that sparks pride and passions across the United States often greater than those produced by professional teams. But the one thing lacking from the spectacle has been the kind of playoffs so beloved of US sports enthusiasts -- head-to-head competitions that let fans point to the last team standing as true and deserving champions. Instead, for decades, rankings or polls determined the national collegiate football champion. For the last 16 years, the Bowl Championship Series system pitted two top teams in a title game based on a combination of human polls and computer rankings. Confetti was sprayed onto the field as the Ohio Buckeyes celebrate being crowned national champions. They went into the game as underdogs . This season, a selection committee of 13 chose and seeded four teams to play in semi-final games. The University of Oregon steamrolled defending national champions Florida State 59-20 in the Rose Bowl, which served as one playoff semi-final. Ohio State rallied to beat top-ranked Alabama 42-35 in the Sugar Bowl - which was the other semi-final game. And on Monday, Ohio State powered past the Ducks in front of 85,689 fans at AT&T Stadium, the billion-dollar home of the NFL's Dallas Cowboys. Oregon boasted quarterback Marcus Mariota, winner of the coveted Heisman Trophy as the country's top collegiate player. But it was the Buckeyes' second-year running back Elliott who starred, putting the game away with three touchdown runs in the second half. Ohio State defender Eli Apple punctuated the victory by intercepting a Mariota pass on the final play of the game. The victory capped an improbable championship run for Ohio State, who lost star quarterback Braxton Miller before the season. Backup J.T. Barrett kept the ship on course, but broke his ankle in November, leaving third-string quarterback Cardale Jones to lead the Buckeyes to the Big Ten conference title and their Sugar Bowl victory. Mariota threw two touchdown passes, including a seven-yard strike to Keanon Lowe on their opening drive. Mariota connected with Byron Marshall on a 70-yard catch and run for a touchdown in the third that cut Ohio State's lead to 21-17 in the third.

The sidelines at the College Football National Championship Game were packed with celebrities including GMA anchor Robin Roberts (left) and host Jimmy Kimmel (right) Oregon's defense forced four turnovers, including two in the third quarter as the Ducks pulled within 21-20, but Ohio State responded with two touchdown drives to put the game out of reach. Even before Monday's game the new playoff format had been widely hailed as a success. The two semi-final games produced high-scoring, entertaining contests that drew more than 28 million television viewers apiece, sparking talk of expanding the playoffs from four to eight teams. Following the surprise win, chaotic celebrations broke out in Columbus, Ohio as hundreds of fans gathered in the downtown streets with police struggling to keep order in a city gripped by football fever. Police and SWAT teams dressed in full-camouflage gear and Kevlar helmets used tear gas to disperse the crowds after earlier urging fans to show they 'have class'. Thousands of fans cheering and blowing car horns converged on Ohio State University's stadium shortly after the win, only to be turned away by police. That forced them back to an area of bars around the campus where most of the trouble took place, with between 30 and 40 fires lit in trash cans and dumpsters. One image taken from social networks showed a man pouring fuel on to a sofa which sat burning in the middle of the road. Social media users posted images from the streets of SWAT teams marshaling crowds, and fires burning in the middle of intersections while patrol cars pushed through massed fans.

Ohio State held their helmets aloft and waved copies of Tuesday's Columbus Dispatch newspaper, declaring them the college football champions . Running-back Ezekiel Elliott stuck his tongue out for the cameras as he celebrated the Ohio State victory over Oregon on Monday . The Buckeyes celebrated their historic win at the AT&T Stadium in Texas - the first as part of the newly-integrated college playoff system . The Columbus Dispatch reported that pepper spray was used. Fox8 also obtained footage of fans crowding round police vehicles. Local reporter Jeremy Pelzer uploaded a series of images showing the city's High Street purportedly being hit by tear gas after crowds couldn't be dispersed. He wrote: 'Just saw an officer pepper spray a guy at point-blank range in the face when he was already on his knees in pain.' He had previously pictured SWAT teams gathering on the streets, some of whom were wearing gas masks. Amid the chaos there was time for some romantic scenes as one couple were pictured kissing, while other shots showed friends riding around on each-other's shoulders. A Buckeyes fan tweeted that SWAT teams were facing down fans on High Street, and also said he saw a car on fire. Earlier the Columbus Police Department implored fans to 'show the nation that  has class.' In a tweet they urged fans to 'Party responsibly!' and 'Stay safe!' They said that extra officers were posted on the streets to maintain order.

Police said between 30 and 40 fires were started during the trouble last night, with the majority of those being in trash cans or dumpsters .

         "By . Anthony Bond . PUBLISHED: . 07:03 EST, 2 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 08:07 EST, 2 March 2013 . Three members of the same family who died in a static caravan from carbon monoxide poisoning would have been unconscious 'within minutes', investigators said today. The bodies of married couple John and Audrey Cook were discovered alongside their daughter, Maureen, at the mobile home they shared on Tremarle Home Park in Camborne, west Cornwall. The inquests have now opened into the deaths last Saturday, with investigators saying the three died along with the family's pet dog, of carbon monoxide poisoning from a cooker. Tragic: The inquests have opened into the deaths of three members of the same family who were found in their static caravan last weekend. John and Audrey Cook are pictured . Awful: The family died following carbon monoxide poisoning at this caravan at the Tremarle Home Park in Camborne, Cornwall . It is also believed there was no working carbon monoxide detector in the static caravan. Cornwall Fire and Rescue Service said this would have resulted in the three being unconscious 'within minutes', . A spokesman for Cornwall coroner Dr Emma Carlyon confirmed the inquests were opened and adjourned yesterday afternoon. They will resume at a later date. Devon and Cornwall Police confirmed on Monday that carbon monoxide poisoning had been established as the cause of death. A police spokesman said the source of the poisoning was 'believed to be from incorrect operation of the gas cooker'. Poisoning: This woman left flowers outside the caravan following the deaths.

         "UNITED NATIONS (CNN) -- A rare meeting of U.N. Security Council heads of state, led for the first time by a U.S. president, adopted a resolution focused on stopping the spread of nuclear weapons Thursday. President Obama is the first U.S. leader to head a United Nations Security Council meeting. President Obama challenged the gathering -- which included leaders of nuclear powers including Russia, China, Great Britain and France -- to overcome cynicism against the goal of ridding the planet of nuclear arms. \"We harbor no illusions about the difficulty of bringing about a world without nuclear weapons,\" Obama said, adding that Thursday's meeting signaled a significant step forward in cooperative global action. The resolution, which was adopted unanimously, calls for tighter controls on nuclear materials to prevent them from being used for military purposes or stolen. It also encourages enforcement of international treaties and U.N. resolutions regarding nuclear non-proliferation, particularly when nations such as Iran and North Korea are in violation. \"The world must stand together,\" Obama said. \"We must demonstrate that international law is not an empty promise.\" It was the first Security Council summit chaired by a U.S. president, and only the fifth time that Security Council heads of state have met. Obama led the meeting because the United States holds the revolving presidency of the Security Council in September. Both Obama and Russian President Dimitry Medvedev, who spoke later, said the world's two nuclear superpowers were working on reducing their stockpiles in advance of a global nuclear summit scheduled for next year. \"It's obvious that an effective solution ... depends on the constructive engagement of all parties,\" Medvedev said, adding that he expected the Russia-U.S. leadership on the issue to be backed by \"all nuclear powers.\" The measure passed Thursday -- Security Council resolution 1887 -- calls for \"locking down vulnerable nuclear weapons materials in four years\" while minimizing civilian use of weapons-grade uranium. It encourages full compliance with all international treaties and resolutions on nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament, including Security Council resolutions that cite North Korea and Iran for failing to adhere to international commitments. In addition, the resolution supports the peaceful use of nuclear energy, a theme backed by Chinese President Hu Jintao. China seeks to expand its nuclear energy capacity as part of an economic development plan that holds down greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change. British Prime Minister Gordon Brown also cited the role of nuclear power as a clean energy source that should be part of the solution to global warming affecting every nation. Brown and other leaders spoke of the need to prevent nuclear weapons or the materials to make them from ending up in the hands of terrorist groups. \"The biggest risk the world faces today is of extremists getting hold of nuclear materials,\" said Mohammad ElBaradei, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency. Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, who criticized the Security Council on Wednesday in a rambling speech to the U.N. General Assembly, was absent for the meeting. In Libya's turn to speak at the summit, its special representative to the United Nations called for the IAEA to inspect all nuclear programs, including Israel's, instead of focusing on non-nuclear states. Asked later about Gadhafi's absence, White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said Libya could serve as an example to Iran and North Korea as a nation that gave up its nuclear weapons program and now had rejoined the full international community. \"I think the message that the Libyans had at the Security Council is a message that we hope that the Iranians and the North Koreans will take to heart, and that is giving up a nuclear weapons program and the benefits that it can have for international cooperation and for their reintegration into an international community,\" Gibbs said. Brown earlier called for sanctions against Iran for its efforts to develop a nuclear weapon. On Wednesday, Medvedev signaled that Russia -- which previously has opposed such move -- also could support sanctions against Iran. \"Russia's position is clear: sanctions rarely lead to productive results, but in some cases sanctions are inevitable,\" Medvedev said in a joint appearance with Obama after they met in New York. The statement bolsters U.S.-led efforts for increased international pressure on Iran to adhere to nonproliferation agreements in pursuing the development of nuclear energy. Iran claims its nuclear program is intended for peaceful purposes, but the international community accuses it of continuing to try to develop nuclear weapons capability. The Iranian mission to the United Nations released a statement after the Security Council meeting, saying the country's nuclear activities \"are and always have been, for peaceful purposes, and, therefore, pose no threat whatsoever.\" \"In practicing its legitimate right to develop nuclear energy technology, Iran has always maintained its need for nuclear power as an alternative source of energy to supply its booming population and rapid development. ... Our commitment to nonproliferation remains intact,\" the statement added. The United States and Russia previously have disagreed over Iran, and over possible steps the Security Council may take -- including imposing sanctions -- to push Tehran to comply with U.N. demands concerning its nuclear program. Last week, Obama announced that the United States was dropping plans to base a missile defense shield system in Poland and the Czech Republic, a proposal that had rankled Moscow. He has denied the change was directly linked to Russia's position regarding sanctions on Iran, but said any Russian shift in that direction would be a bonus.",

         "Cover-up: Former Archbishop Lord Hope allowed a paedophile priest to escape punishment for sex crimes, a judge's report claims . A former archbishop who failed to act on alleged crimes of a paedophile priest should be jailed, the abuser’s victims have said. Lord Hope, the former Archbishop of York, did not act on 19 occasions when allegations of abuse or inappropriate conduct by the priest were raised with him, a scathing report revealed yesterday. But despite that, Lord Hope remains as an honorary assistant bishop in the Diocese of Bradford. Eli Ward and Bim Atkinson, who were among seven victims of the Very Reverend Robert Waddington, former Dean of Manchester, said it is ‘incredible’ that the man who did nothing to stop the priest has been allowed to keep his post. The report by Judge Sally Cahill QC said Lord Hope failed to act because his ‘concern for the welfare of Robert Waddington seems to have been paramount’. Waddington, who kept an official position in the church until 2005 and died in 2007, targeted young choirboys over several decades. One of the seven victims committed suicide in 1989. Mr Atkinson, 59, who was abused when Waddington was a priest in Australia in the 1960s, sent a picture of disgraced Tory peer Lord Archer, who was jailed for perjury, to the Bishop of North Queensland Bill Ray, adding: ‘I would be pushing for Lord Hope to be treated in the same way as this fellow.’ Mr Ward, now 41, was abused by Waddington between the ages of 11 and 15 as a chorister at Manchester Cathedral. He said: ‘It’s just incredible Lord Hope still has a position. Here is a guy who shoved it all under the carpet. 'He failed and failed to do anything and yet nothing has happened to him. He is still allowed to sit in the House of Lords.’ He added: ‘I’d like to see him punished. My opinion is that he’s committed a crime, perverting the course of justice, and should face the consequences.’ Robert Waddington died in 2007 - he had been accused of abusing seven different victims between 1955 and 1996 . Mr Ward said he left the choir when he was 15 after church officials became concerned – but the priest was allowed to remain as the dean in charge of the cathedral until 1993. Waddington then moved to York Minster, where more children were abused. He stayed in a lesser post there until 2005, despite the allegations made to Lord Hope, according to the report, which was commissioned by current Archbishop of York, the Most Reverend John Sentamu. Mr Ward said: ‘Here we had a church body which had been preaching at us to be morally correct yet, when it came to doing the same thing themselves, they were incapable.’ Mr Ward, now living in the Home Counties with a long-term girlfriend, added that he has put the abuse behind him. But he believes Waddington’s abuse was responsible for the death of another victim, a former chorister from Carlisle named in the report only as Peter, who was abused in the 1970s, developed depression and schizophrenia, and committed suicide in 1989. Lord Hope, 76, has described Judge Cahill’s report as ‘flawed’ but offered a ‘personal and profound apology’. He said: ‘This report makes it clear that not applying the policy is not the same as a cover-up. Hindsight is a wonderful thing.’",

'Jerry Springer, \"THAT'S A MAN\" kind of thing'. The New Jersey-based transgender woman claimed that she had signed onto the show as an example of how 'a beautiful transgendered woman' can get 'hit on at a bar' and 'IT'S OK!'. Glamour: Miss Carerra, seen above in New York on February 3, rose to fame as a contestant on the reality TV show RuPaul's Drag Race .

         "'The lamps are going out all over Europe. We shall not see them lit again in our lifetime' Foreign Secretary Sir Edward Grey, August 3, 1914 . Prime Minister David Cameron is urging Britons to switch off their lights for an hour tomorrow evening to mark the 100th anniversary of Britain’s declaration of war on Germany in 1914. The Lights Out initiative will be the culmination of a day of commemorative events across the country and in Europe, with members of the Royal Family fully involved at home and abroad. Millions of homes, offices and public and private buildings, such as Tower Bridge and 10 Downing Street, will be included in the ‘shared moment of reflection’ between 10pm and 11pm, leaving just a single candle or bulb illuminating a window as a symbol of ‘continuing hope in the darkness’. The initiative was inspired by then Foreign Secretary Sir Edward Grey’s remark at the outbreak of the First World War: ‘The lamps are going out all over Europe. We shall not see them lit again in our lifetime.’ Mr Cameron told The Mail on Sunday: ‘Lights Out is a way for everyone to mark the First World War centenary and I would encourage people to take part and turn off their lights tomorrow at 10pm for an hour, apart from a single light or candle. ‘This will be a personal gesture in remembrance of all those who made the ultimate sacrifice for us 100 years ago. They must never be forgotten.’ The national commemorations will begin with a morning service of prayers, hymns and readings in Glasgow Cathedral linked to the conclusion of the Commonwealth Games. The event will be attended by Commonwealth leaders, Mr Cameron and Prince Charles. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will attend a remembrance service in Liege, Belgium, before joining Prince Harry and Mr Cameron for a commemoration organised by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission in Mons, where the first and last British soldiers who died on the Western Front are buried. At 10pm, to coincide with the start of the ‘Lights Out’ initiative, a vigil service will be held at Westminster Abbey during which members of the congregation will extinguish candles until there is just one left alight on the tomb of the unknown soldier, which will be snuffed out by the Duchess of Cornwall. Scroll down for video . Poignant: Young drummers in Sandhurst, Berkshire, will lead a special service . During the day, there will be a number of Church of England services attended by other members of the Royal family including the Queen, who will be at Balmoral in Scotland, and Prince Philip, at Sandringham in Norfolk. Other special events will be held up and down the UK, including a commemorative service led by Sandhurst and District Corps of Drums in Berkshire. Labour’s spokesman on the First World War commemorations, Dan Jarvis, said: ‘With the busy lives we lead today, the simple act of pausing, switching off the lights and lighting a candle will be a very powerful tribute.’",

         "Roy Hodgson has come under fire for making public Raheem Sterling's admission that he was feeling tired ahead of England's Euro 2016 qualifier with Estonia. The Liverpool star told the England manager that he was too fatigued to start the match in Tallinn after shouldering a heavy burden this season for both club and country. Hodgson then made Sterling's comments public ahead of the match, which England won 1-0 thanks to Wayne Rooney's second-half free-kick. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Roy Hodgson: Raheem came to me complaining of tiredness . England manager Roy Hodgson was criticised for making public Raheem Sterling's admission that he was feeling tired ahead of Sunday's Euro 2016 win over Estonia . Sterling did not make England's starting XI in Tallinn but came on as a second-half substitute . Sterling was replaced by his Liverpool teammate Adam Lallana in the starting line-up but came on as a second-half substitute. Sky Sports pundits and former Liverpool players Jamie Redknapp and Jamie Carragher both criticised Hodgson for not keeping their conversation private. Redknapp said: 'I would never have dreamed of saying that  to an England manager, but then I picked up a lot of injuries. 'I'm sure Brendan Rodgers would have been leaning on him,  you need a break and this is an opportunity to get one. 'Why on earth did Hodgson say it though? Honesty is not the best policy. Why has Roy got into this? He could have said 'I want to freshen this up.' This wouldn't even be a conversation.' Sky Sports pundit Jamie Redknapp said Hodgson should have kept the conversation with Sterling private . Jamie Carragher, also talking on Sky Sports, agreed that Hodgson should have used more discretion . Carragher agreed that discretion would have been a better idea: 'Me as a player, I would never give a manager a chance to leave me out. 'But keep it between yourselves, just come out and say Lallana played well last game and say Raheem needs a rest. But now we are having a debate on it. 'Hodgson could have been more careful, but I don't think Rodgers would have been involved.' Sterling, 19, came off the bench to win the 74th-minute free-kick that led to England skipper Rooney curled in for his 43rd international goal. Hodgson said after the game: 'People don't like it when you simplistically tell the truth. We were training at The Grove doing a light session but some work in how we wanted to play the game tactically. Hodgson chats to Sterling during training on the eve of the match in Tallinn, which England won 1-0 . Sterling's Liverpool teammate Adam Lallana started in his place in the England midfield diamond . 'Just before we started, Raheem had done the warm up and he came to me and said ''look I really am feeling a bit tired, I'm not in my best form at the moment because I am feeling a bit tired''. 'So I said best thing is Adam Lallana starts the game and you rest and I have got you to bring on from the bench, simple as that. 'As you saw when he came on there is nothing wrong with him and he isn't suffering from anything. 'It was a question of having two players, who both did pretty well against San Marino and one is telling me he is a bit tired and jaded, the other one is full of beans. 'We'll put the one on who is full of beans and keep the other one up your sleeve. 'I think it would be wrong of players to try to fool me into think they are ready and that they're 100 per cent when they aren't because they are robbing somebody else of an opportunity. I thought Lallana had a good game.'",

         "Every frontline police officer should be offered a Taser to help fight the threat from lone-wolf terrorists, a police leader declared yesterday. Steve White, who chairs the Police Federation, said evidence of plans to murder officers made the move necessary. ‘The terrorist ideal to get attention no longer relies on an attack being in a place of note,’ he said. ‘It could be in Cheam high street, in any town, in any part of the UK. We know there are more dangerous people out there, preparing to attack police officers and we need to be able to respond to that threat.’ Steve White, who chairs the Police Federation, said evidence of plans to murder officers made it necessary for every frontline officer to be offered a taser . Leaders of the Police Federation are set to vote next month about whether every uniformed officer should be offered training in the use of a Taser . The terrorist threat level for police was raised to severe two weeks ago in the wake of the Paris atrocity and a foiled assault on officers in Belgium. Since then, police chiefs and junior officers have been considering how to counter the extra dangers. Last December, a threat was made to kidnap and kill a policeman in the West Midlands. Officers were given extra security briefings and urged not to travel to work in uniform. Leaders of the Police Federation, which represents rank-and-file officers, will vote next month on a proposal that every uniformed frontline officer should be offered training in the use of Tasers, though some may choose not to carry them. The weapons, which carry an electric current of up to 50,000 volts to incapacitate dangerous suspects, have been linked to at least ten deaths in England and Wales over the past decade. Some senior officers are believed to support the idea in theory, but one police leader said chief constables would be mostly opposed. The police chief, speaking anonymously, told the Guardian: ‘The idea of arming every police officer with a Taser is alien to 200 years of police culture. It is a stepping stone to arming the police – something strapped to your hip that looks like a firearm is a huge shift in what we stand for.’",

         "By . Dan Bloom . It's one very, very small step for man - but a giant leap for antkind. Around 800 common ants, usually found pattering across pavements and picnics, have been sent to the International Space Station to teach scientists how they move in low gravity. Eight colonies each about the size of a tablet computer have been set up to teach experts how to build robots which interact with each other. Welcome: Nasa astronaut Rick Mastracchio greets 800 new friends aboard the International Space Station. Scientists will study how ants work together in low gravity and copy their methods to develop robots . Small steps: Each of the eight colonies is the size of a tablet computer and can be expanded to examine how the insects work together in different-sized environments . As the colonies are expanded, the ants move from small circles to straight lines to cover more ground . Houseguests: The colonies were delivered alongside Christmas presents for ISS astronauts . It is because ants inside colonies move according to internalised rules, judging how many other ants are nearby by touching antenna and using their sense of smell. Working together, the ants cover a piece of ground comprehensively to find food and supplies. When the area expands they change from moving in small circles to scuttling in straighter lines, covering more ground. But in the micro gravity of space, the ants' rules are confounded and they have to develop a new set of innate principles by which to work. These flexible principles could then be adapted to instruct robots to work together in the same way, for tasks like searching a burning building. Video cameras are trained on the experiment and images of the pavement ants, as they are known, are being beamed back to Earth. Close-up: The images will be beamed back to Earth. Pictured: Nasa flight engineer Mike Hopkins . Significant: The experiment could help develop robots which search disaster zones or burning buildings . These will be monitored by students at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas, and compared to a similar colony in their classroom. Stefanie Countryman, a professor at Bioserve Space Technologies, the private firm which launched the mission, told Bionews Texas: 'When ant densities are high, each ant thoroughly searches one small area in a circular, â€˜randomâ€™ walk. 'When ant densities are low, each ant searches by walking in a relatively straight line, allowing it to cover more ground.' The unusual cargo was delivered by an unmanned supply rocket this week which also included 28 mini-satellites known as Doves. Each less than 2ft across, they contain ultra high definition cameras which could track crop harvests, climate change and natural disasters like wildfires and floods. The cargo also included Christmas presents for those aboard the International Space Station - which were supposed to be delivered last month. The ants' launch had to be delayed several times after emergency repairs, America's 'polar vortex' of cold weather and a strong solar storm all intervened.",

This week they uncovered it - a boulder that's thousands of years old and bigger than an SUV, weighing an estimated 150 tons or 300,000lbs. A geotechnical engineer who was called out to examine the giant rock in Everett, Washington. The rock, which weighs 150 tons and is bigger than an SUV was discovered in Everett, Washington. It is believed that a glacier left the 'erratic rock' there around 18,000 years ago . An excavator digs around a glacial erratic rock discovered at the Courtyard by Marriott construction site last Thursday and then fully unearthed on Wednesday . The rock is bigger than an SUV and close to 19 feet long and 10 feet wide, The Daily Herald reported. Several drill bits were broken due to the rock. Geotechnical expert Kurt Merriman, told The Daily Herald it's a glacial erratic - a giant rock left behind by a glacier. maybe 18,000 years ago. It is likely that the boulder traveled from northern Canada or Alaska, the engineer said. The site superintendent for the Halvorson Construction Group, Ben Hansen, said it may give the boulder to the city to try to find it a home. Work on the new Courtyard by Marriot hotel was suspended following the fascinating find. A glacial erratic is a piece of rock that is totally different from the size and type of rock in the area where it has been found. 'Erratics' are normally carried by glacial ice, often over distances of hundreds of kilometers. Glacial erratics can range from pebbles to one of the largest ever found in Alberta, Canada.

A few more stopped to write messages on \"Love Notes,\" little cards designed to encourage Taylor Love through the tough time. \"Her mom reads them to her before she goes to bed at night,\" Abby said. \"Taylor gets excited for them and she loves getting them read to her because she likes knowing that people are supporting her and people are actually thinking of her.\" Taylor has neuroblastoma, a cancer that affects the nervous system. According to her Web site, she is in remission, but this type of cancer has a high risk of recurrence. There has been little research on the illness, of which there are about 650 new cases in the United States each year. Mike Gillette, a family friend of both Taylor and Abby, brought the two girls together. While raising money and support for Taylor is important, he said, he thinks Abby's outreach can help bring more critical awareness for the devastating disease. \"She really wanted to reach people all over the country,\" he said. Gillette said he has taken Abby to do similar performances in the District of Columbia, New Jersey and Virginia, and estimates they've raised thousands of dollars and have gotten people to write several hundred \"Love Notes.\" Abby does more than just raise money and awareness for her friend. Taylor's mother, Aimee, said that although Abby is eight years older than Taylor, the two see each other often and have a special connection that helps her get through her daughter's illness. \"I think it's amazing for a 12-year-old Abby to be drawn to my daughter, who is 4 and wants to inspire other children,\" Aimee Love said. \"The joy I see in Taylor when she sees Abby brings a light into my life.\" Taylor's family said her treatments are terribly painful. But Abby said Taylor has enormous character. \"She's the most happy girl in the world, which I think is just incredible,\" Abby said. \"She's so much fun to be around. She's a little 4-year-old girl but she's got a heart of like a thousand grown adults.\" Aimee Love said her daughter feels the same way about Abby. \"It gives her someone to aspire to, someone to be inspired by,\" she said.",

         "Denise Shepherd, 19, who died from an overdose of heroin and a cocktail of pills after becoming addicted to drugs aged 11 . A teenage girl died from an overdose of heroin and a cocktail of pills after becoming addicted to drugs when she was aged just 11, an inquest has heard. Denise Shepherd started smoking cannabis before starting secondary school and then progressed to harder drugs such as heroin. In June last year, aged 19, she was found dead in the flat she shared with her boyfriend Jamie Hayne in Eastbourne, East Sussex, when he woke in the early hours of the morning and found she had stopped breathing. At an inquest into her death at Eastbourne Magistrate's Court, her mother Joann Bell told the coroner how her daughter had moved into her flat in a bid to get her to stop taking drugs but was later joined by Mr Hayne. The pair were said to be drinking heavily and were suspected of taking drugs. However, two days before Miss Shepherd, who was unemployed, was found dead, Ms Bell moved out of the flat. She said her daughter and Mr Hayne had a volatile relationship and didn't clean up after themselves. She said: 'They became increasingly difficult to live with. 'I struggled financially because they came to me for food.' She also told the hearing how her daughter had smoked cannabis from a very early age after she had 'fallen in with the wrong crowd'. Coronor Alan Craze was also told how a neighbour had tried to administer CPR to Miss Shepherd when she was discovered unconscious. When paramedics arrived they too were unable to revive her and it is feared she may have been dead for some time. Mr Craze then recorded a verdict of death due to a dependence on drugs. The inquest at Eastbourne Magistrates Court, pictured, saw Coroner Alan Craze record a verdict of death due to a dependence on drugs . Speaking after the inquest, Ms Bell said she has tried to warn her daughter about the dangers of drugs. She said: 'It is so difficult. People won’t talk to their parents about drugs. 'I tried to sit down and talk to her calmly but I never was aware exactly what was going on. 'I wouldn’t have moved out if I had known. 'She was gullible, naive and easily-led. 'She would be an aunty now. Her brother is now a father. She would have loved being an aunty.'",

         "Las Vegas (CNN) -- The makers of Gorilla Glass, the glass that's used in touchscreen gadgets such as iPhones, iPads and more than 500 other models of electronic gadgets, has officially unveiled a thinner and more touch-sensitive version of their product. When it comes to innovation in electronic gadgets, a new kind of glass is not especially sexy. But when that glass is built into millions of touchscreen devices, and could potentially make them thinner, lighter and more responsive to your finger, consumers may take notice. Corning Inc. says Gorilla Glass 2 is thinner and more touch-sensitive without sacrificing toughness or resistance to scratches. The company showed off the glass Monday at a gadget-showcase event at the International Consumer Electronics Show here and is showing live demos of its enhanced qualities at the Corning booth throughout the four-day show. The new glass is not any less resistant to breakage than the current Gorilla Glass, which may be disappointing news to anyone who has had to put up with a cracked screen after dropping a phone. \"It's not scratch-proof. And if they drop it on granite, it can be broken,\" said Corning general manager Clifford Hund. But he added that Corning has managed to make the glass 20% thinner but just as strong -- a key advancement at a time when smartphone and tablet makers are trying to produce ever-thinner devices. The second generation of Gorilla Glass will debut in Windows-based PCs this year. Other manufacturers also are weighing how and when to add the glass to their upcoming devices, Hund said. Because it's thinner -- about 0.8 millimeters instead of 1 millimeter -- the glass allows users' fingers to be closer to the touch interface, creating a screen that responds more quickly and accurately, said Gorilla Glass program director Jaymin Amin. The glass also has been engineered to let more light through, creating a brighter display screen, Corning executives said. Due to customer nondisclosure agreements, Corning cannot name all the devices that use Gorilla Glass -- including Apple products. But according to multiple other sources, including Walter Isaacson's recent biography of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, the product's first consumer application was the original iPhone in 2007. A passage from Isaacson's book details how Apple had originally planned to use plastic display coverings for its iPhone before Jobs approached Corning CEO Wendell Weeks about ordering glass instead. Weeks told him Corning had developed a tough form of glass, made extra strong by a chemical process, but couldn't find a market for it. Weeks didn't think Corning could manufacture the glass fast enough to meet Apple's timetable for the iPhone launch. But at the prodding of Jobs, who wouldn't take no for an answer, Corning did it in six months. After the iPhone hit the market, Jobs sent Weeks a note that said, \"We couldn't have done it without you.\" Gorilla Glass also is part of touchscreens in electronic devices by Acer, Asus, Dell, HTC, LG, Motorola, Nokia, Samsung and Sony, among other manufacturers. Amin demonstrated its toughness Monday by placing a small square of the original glass in a lever press, then applying more than 100 pounds of pressure onto it. Despite looking like he was truly exerting himself, he couldn't break it. Amin then tested the new glass the same way and got the same result.",

         "Los Angeles (CNN) -- \"Teflon Don\" rapper Rick Ross crashed his silver Rolls Royce into an apartment building after he heard gunfire along a Fort Lauderdale, Florida, street Monday morning, police said. \"The driver of the Rolls Royce attempted to drive away from the direction of the shots being fired and lost control of the vehicle, striking a nearby apartment building,\" Fort Lauderdale Police Detective DeAnna Garcia said. Ross and a female passenger were not hurt by the wreck or the gunshots, Garcia said. \"The suspects fled from the area prior to police arrival,\" she said. The incident, however, called attention to threats against the artist's life made in a street gang's videos and posted online in recent months. \"We're pulling up on you,\" a man who identified himself as a member of the Gangster Disciples warned in one of the videos. \"Whatever city, whatever state, the pressure on.\" Several videos purporting to be from Gangster Disciple members in several states -- including Georgia, North Carolina and Florida -- appeared on YouTube late last year demanding that Ross pay a fee to them for his use of the Star of David, which they claim as a gang symbol, and a reference to one of their founders in his music and marketing. \"You got to cut the check,\" one video said. \"Tell your boss man he got to get that check, or all you in trouble.\" \"We need that cash right now,\" another said. Ross, 37, whose albums include \"Teflon Don\" in 2010 and \"Deeper Than Rap\" a year earlier, told south Florida radio station 99 Jamz last month that he was not intimidated by the threats. \"Ain't never no checks getting cut,\" he said. \"I don't play those games. I consider that extortion.\" Is Nas hip-hop's finest MC? Ross did cancel his North Carolina shows last month just days after a video appeared online threatening his life if he performed there. \"Never was it due to any threats,\" he told the radio station. Instead, he canceled because \"the promoter wasn't really handling his business.\" Ross wanted to make certain that listeners understood he was not frightened. \"Don't ever get it twisted, Ricky Ross is the boss,\" he said. The death threats are not the only challenge to Ross. A former drug lord and gang leader is suing in a Los Angeles court, accusing him of stealing his name and reputation. \"The reality is I want justice done,\" the original Ross wrote in an e-mail to CNN. \"I know that he took his name and image from my life and believe he is unfairly profiting off my story.\" Ricky \"Freeway\" Ross was serving a prison sentence a decade ago when rapper William Roberts, who previously worked as a Florida correctional officer, adopted \"Rick Ross\" as his stage name, according to the lawsuit. \"This rapper and his labels clearly knew of my name and story, and have tried to suck out the lifeblood without license,\" the former drug lord said. \"I have my own use for my intellectual property and did not need this confusion created.\" More recently, the rapper has been using the name \"Ricky Rozay.\" The rapper and his record label have not responded to CNN's request for comment.

Aside from her fashion designing duties, 40-year-old Kate has been quietly creating a new beauty range for Rimmel London. The colourful collection of mascaras, lipsticks, eyeliners and nail varnish is bound to brighten up the nation's make-up bags this season and Kate shows us how to work the season's best beauty trends in the new campaign imagery. Does she ever stop? Kate Moss has unveiled a new beauty range for Rimmel London and models the colour-popping shades in the new imagery . Kate, who has been working with the beauty giant for several years, has created her first-ever eye collection called Idol Eyes - a fitting name for the world-famous supermodel.

'The intense authentic shades of mascara, eye colour and liner are perfect for creating either a statement or more subtle eye look.' Kate has also created four shadow sticks, which aim to illuminate eyes in one stroke, and to recreate her legendary eyeliner flick, fans can use her gel liner in dark emerald green. Boho babe: Speaking about the inspiration behind her boho themed beauty line, she said: 'I've always loved the laid-back bohemian look because it's all about individual creativity and self-expression' Kate has added her own range to the Salon Pro nail polish collection and explains that she has created five Bohemian shades, which will no doubt perfectly complement her new Topshop range. As for lips, Kate's previous collections have been some of the brand's best-selling and she has capitalised on this by expanding it. 'I've always loved the laid-back bohemian look because it's all about individual creativity and self-expression,' she said. 'I've worked with Rimmel to create a palette that combines rich, earthy tones with cool brights and soft nudes.

She's also a fan of . scouring the rails of second hand stores. A weave waistcoat, suede . shorts and a deep blue fringed jacket are all in keeping with the . Seventies vibe. The latter is said to be inspired by a jacket the . 40-year-old has worn to three Rolling Stones concerts which she refers . to as her 'gig . jacket'. As well as . channelling a vintage look, she was also keen to reflect her laidback . style. There are baggy pyjama trousers glammed up through the use of satin . material in distinct prints and cool kaftans perfect for hitting the . beach in over the summer.

Meanwhile there are also some tailored pieces for smart office wear including tuxedo style outfits and trouser suits as well as summery floral printed shirts. While much of the collection will be sold at affordable prices, one dress is a more pricey £600. The high price tag is to reflect the precise work that went into creating the densely hand-beaded dress. Kate first collaborated with Topshop in 2007 before taking a break to work on other projects.",

         "LIKE James Bond, Sir Roger Moore has at times enjoyed a martini. But the actor has revealed he can no longer drink the cocktail because of his Type 2 diabetes. Sir Roger, 86, was diagnosed with the condition last year, and it means he has to watch the amount of sugar and alcohol he consumes. A martini is a highly alcoholic cocktail, made from a combination of gin and vermouth. And it was Bond’s drink of choice when Sean Connery played the spy. Shaken not stirred: Sir Roger Moore, who starred in seven James Bond films, drinks a martini in 1968 . Opening up about his health condition, Sir Roger said: ‘I make a very good dry martini but I’m not allowed to drink them any more. No more sugar, no alcohol. I get to taste the wine and I can make a little sip last an hour. I enjoy it much more. I remember a lot more of what happened.’ Typically a martini is a gin-based drink, although it can also be made with vodka. In the 007 films Bond is known for ordering his martinis ‘shaken not stirred’, referring to the way in which they are made. The cocktail can also be made ‘with a twist’, which involves lemon peel, or ‘dirty’, where it contains olive brine. It was Connery’s Bond who drank martinis, Sir Roger explained, first uttering the ‘shaken not stirred’ catchphrase in Goldfinger. Sir Roger (pictured in 2013) was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes last year and can no longer drink martinis . In the past Sir Roger has admitted having a taste for champagne. These days, however, he sticks to soft drinks, claiming his ‘vice’ to be Diet Coke. And he has come up a guilt-free virgin cocktail – a Band Aid – which is a combination of non-alcoholic beer and Diet Coke. ‘No calories and it’s delicious,’ Sir Roger said. Giving an interview to the Sunday Telegraph the actor, who starred in seven James Bond films, went on to joke that he would indulge in martinis and ice cream if he knew he only had one day left to live. He said: ‘When I’m told I’ve got 24 hours to go, I’m going to have a couple of dry martinis with Tanqueray gin - not vodka - and a couple of choc ices with plain chocolate on the outside and white, white vanilla on the inside - oh, and baked beans.’ Sir Roger, who last appeared as 007 almost 30 years ago, revealed he had been diagnosed with diabetes last year. He had collapsed at home in Monaco and been rushed into hospital by his fourth wife Kristina Tholstrup. Doctors confirmed that the star, who had been losing weight for some time, was suffering from the condition. Appearing on US TV’s Late Show with David Letterman ‘I went to the doctor, and he said, “You know those high blood-sugar numbers you’ve been dealing with since you were 36? Well, you’ve graduated! You’ve got Type 2 diabetes, young man”.’ In the past Sir Roger has survived prostate cancer and had a pacemaker inserted.",

         "LONDON, England -- Scientists in the U.S. are developing a laser gun that could kill millions of mosquitoes in minutes. The WHO has reported that around half of the world's population is at risk of malaria. The laser, which has been dubbed a \"weapon of mosquito destruction\" fires at mosquitoes once it detects the audio frequency created by the beating of its wings. The laser beam then destroys the mosquito, burning it on the spot. Developed by some of the astrophysicists involved in what was known as the \"Star Wars\" anti-missile programs during the Cold War, the project is meant to prevent the spread of malaria. Lead scientist on the project, Dr. Jordin Kare, told CNN that the laser would be able to sweep an area and \"toast millions of mosquitoes in a few minutes.\" Malaria is a life-threatening disease caused by parasites that are transmitted to people from the bites of female mosquitoes. It is particularly prevalent in tropical and sub-tropical regions of the world and kills an African child every 30 seconds, according to the World Health Organization. There are an estimated 300 million acute cases of malaria each year globally, resulting in more than one million deaths, the WHO reports. Responding to questions about any potential harm the laser could pose to the eco-system, Kare said: \"There is no such thing as a good mosquito, there's nothing that feeds exclusively on them. No one would miss mosquitoes,\" he said. \"In any case,\" he added. \"The laser is able to distinguish between mosquitoes that go after people and those that aren't dangerous. What remains to be seen is how precise we can get.\" He added that other insects would not be affected by the laser's beam. Kare said the lasers could be mounted on lamp post-type poles and put around the circumference of villages, to create a kind of \"fence\" against mosquitoes. The research was commissioned by Intellectual Ventures, a Washington, U.S.-based company that was founded by Nathan Myhrvold, a former Microsoft Corporation executive. His previous boss, Bill Gates, who funded the research, asked Myhrvold to look into new ways of combating malaria.",

         "New York Yankees pitcher Michael Pineda has been suspended for 10 games after being caught using pine tar to help him grip the ball. The commissioner's office announced the penalty. The ban was to start for Thursday night's game in Boston unless Pineda appealed. There was no immediate word on whether Pineda would challenge the suspension. Suspicious substance: Michael Pineda was ejected from the game after umpires found a foreign substance on his neck . Pineda was . ejected in the second inning of Wednesday night's 5-1 loss at Fenway . Park after umpires found the pine tar on his neck. After the game, Pineda admitted he had used the pine tar to help him hold the ball on a cool, windy night. 'I'll learn from this mistake,' he said. 'It won't happen again.' Pine . tar is a sticky substance that baseball players will often put on the . handles of their bats to improve grip. Pitchers will use it for the same . reason, particularly in cold weather. However, MLB rules say that a . pitcher can't put any foreign substance on the ball because it can . potentially make the ball move more when a pitcher throws a curve ball. So pitchers will often try and hide it. If they get caught, they are . typically thrown out of the game - and that's exactly what happened to . Pineda. Scroll down for video . Busted: The substance was clearly visible on the pitcher's neck . The . right-hander was thrown out in the second inning when plate umpire . Gerry Davis found the substance on the right side of Pineda's neck after . Red Sox manager John Farrell asked him to check. Pineda walked from the . mound without protest. Both Pineda and Davis said it was pine tar. 'When . it's that obvious, something has got to be said,' Farrell explained . after the game. 'Our awareness was heightened, given what we had seen in . the past.' The ejection also set off a debate in the baseball world about pitchers who use pine tar, and whether it should be allowed in certain circumstances. Many former aces said they had done it, albeit in a more discreet manner. Rule 8.02(b) prohibits pitchers from altering the ball to gain an unfair advantage, and forbids them from having a foreign substance on them or in their possession on the mound. Pineda wasn't seen with the pine tar in the first inning, when the Red Sox roughed him up. Boston manager John Farrell asked plate umpire Gerry Davis to check Pineda after two fast outs the next inning. Got ya: Umpire Gerry Davis determined that the substance on Pineda's neck was pine tar, which is against the rules for pitchers . Earlier . this month, Pineda pitched well against the Red Sox at Yankee Stadium. Television cameras showed a substance on his hand during that outing â€” Pineda said it was dirt, not pine tar. Among . other suspensions of pitchers for pine tar in the past decade, Tampa . Bay's Joel Peralta was penalized eight games in 2012, the Angels' Brendan Donnelly 10 days in 2005 and St. Louis' Julian Tavarez 10 days . in 2004. The suspensions of Donnelly and Tavarez were cut to eight days . after they asked the players' association to appeal, and Peralta dropped . his challenge with no reduction. Yankees general manager Brian Cashman said Pineda and the organization were 'embarrassed.' Yankees manager Joe Girardi called it 'an error in judgment' and a 'little bump' and 'poor judgment.' 'He had a hard time gripping the baseball. Unknown to us, he put it on and went out there,' Girardi said. 'It's a young kid. I don't think he's trying to do anything, cheat. I think he's just trying to go out there and compete.' Obvious: Boston manager John Farrell said that when it's as obvious as it was on Pineda, he has to alert the umpires . In Pineda's previous start against the Red Sox, a 4-1 Yankees win in New York on April 10, television cameras caught Pineda with what appeared to be sticky pine tar on his hand on a cool night. Farrell didn't see a photograph of Pineda's hand until the fourth inning; when Pineda came out to warm up for the fifth, his hand was clean. Pineda said the dark substance was dirt but it sparked debate about pitchers' use of sticky substances to get a better grip on cool nights. On Wednesday, with the game time temperature at 50 degrees, Sizemore started the first with a triple and scored on Dustin Pedroia's single. With one out, Mike Napoli singled Pedroia to third. After Mike Carp flied to left, A.J. Pierzynski singled up the middle, scoring Pedroia. After Pineda's ejection, David Phelps came in and completed the strikeout of Sizemore. Trend: A similar brown, sticky substance was seen on Pineda's hand in another game against Boston on April 10 . John Lackey (3-2) allowed one run and seven hits in eight innings with 11 strikeouts and no walks. Koji Uehara struck out three in the ninth in a non-save situation. The previous time Lackey faced the Yankees he allowed four homers in a 7-2 loss on April 12. On Wednesday, he struck out the side in the third then had two strikeouts in each of the next two innings. Mike Napoli had three hits and Boston scored two runs in the first and two more in the third. The Yankees scored on Alfonso Soriano's sacrifice fly in the sixth.",

         "(CNN) -- Four suspects are sought in connection with the shooting death over the weekend of a Houston, Texas, doctor, Austin County authorities said Monday. Dr. Jorge Mario Gonzales was found shot to death at his ranch in rural Texas on Saturday, police say. Dr. Jorge Mario Gonzalez, 56, was chief of the critical care section at Houston's Methodist Hospital and \"a pulmonary medicine leader,\" according to the hospital system's Web site. He was found dead Saturday when deputies responded to a 911 call of a burglary in progress shortly after noon, said Austin County Sheriff's Office spokesman Sgt. Paul Faircloth. The responding officer was met by vehicles leaving the location, Faircloth said, and a person in one vehicle fired on the officer. The officer and his car were not struck, and the officer did not return fire, Faircloth said. The officer was able to provide a detailed description of the vehicles, he said. At the home, which Faircloth said is in a rural, wooded and isolated area, officers found Gonzalez shot to death and another person wounded. The second victim was airlifted to an Austin, Texas, hospital. Watch Dr. Gonzalez's son talk about his father » . Gonzalez's wife and small child were found unharmed inside the home, Faircloth said. CNN affiliate KHOU identified the woman as Charleen Gonzalez, 29, and the couple's 2-year-old son, and reported the two hid in a closet. Authorities do not know whether the incident was a burglary or an intended home invasion, Faircloth said, and \"we do not know if this is random or targeted.\" Several leads were being followed Monday morning, he said, and numerous agencies were involved in the investigation. The motive for the killing had not been determined on Monday. The slaying took place at Gonzalez's ranch outside Bellville, Texas, said Lisa Block, spokeswoman for the Texas Department of Public Safety. Gonzalez, his wife and child arrived at the ranch about 11 a.m. Saturday, she said, and \"the suspects were at the house when they arrived.\" Gonzalez's wife ran inside with the child and called 911, she said. Ranch worker Noel Galvan was the second victim, Block said. He was listed in critical condition, she said. Faircloth said earlier Monday five suspects were being sought, but later said police were seeking four. The vehicles seen leaving the home were a late '90s white Ford F-150 pickup, occupied by two Hispanic males, Faircloth said, and a red Honda or Acura with dark tinted windows sitting low to the ground, with one Hispanic male inside. The shots were fired from the white pickup, he said. Another vehicle mentioned earlier Monday was a two-toned silver and black Ford F-150 that had two Hispanic males inside. Faircloth said Monday afternoon that vehicle had been located and was not thought to be involved. However, police released a video of a gray Lexus on Monday, and would like to question its owners, Faircloth said. The drivers are believed to be an older couple. The car was seen before the officer encountered the white and red vehicles. \"The manhunt continues on the ground,\" Faircloth said. The suspects are considered armed and dangerous, he said. Faircloth said he had no information on whether the home had surveillance equipment. Family members told KHOU that Gonzalez went to the ranch nearly every weekend. \"It's deeply saddening for all of us,\" an older son of Gonzalez, Juan Mauricio Gonzalez, told KHOU. \"We are a tight-knit family and he was just a perfect man, a perfect father and a great physician.\" The Methodist Hospital System said Gonzalez will be missed, \"both as a friend and an outstanding clinician and researcher. Our prayers and thoughts go out to his family during this tragedy.\" \"This man had nothing to do with anybody,\" Juan Gonzalez told KHOU. \"He was a peaceful man. He was a wise man. He was just here to make people better and nothing else.\" A reward totaling $26,000 was offered for information in the case leading to an arrest. CNN's Melanie Whitley contributed to this report.",

Sir Bob Russell MP offered a two-hour tour around his constituency town of Colchester - but it had no bids on eBay . A walking tour of Britain’s oldest recorded Roman town hosted by an MP has failed to attract any bids in an eBay auction. The two-hour tour of Colchester, Essex, was to be led by Lib Dem Sir Bob Russell around the ‘significant places’ of his life. Part of the East of England Lib Dems’ fundraising efforts, the tour was listed on eBay with a starting price of £40 – but Sir Bob was left red-faced after it failed to attract any bids despite being on offer for a week. The ‘Rome around Colchester’, for one or two people, included high tea in the Castle Park Cafe. The MP, who leads a free walk every New Year's Day, was tight-lipped about where he would escort the winning bidder as part of the tour. The former councillor and Mayor of Colchester, elected to Parliament in 1997, said: 'We do not . get money from big business or trades union to fund our elections - . money is raised by members and supporters.' The sale was one lot in a supposed 'Amazing Autumn Auction' by the East of England Liberal Democrats to raise funds for their European election campaign. But only one item sold as part of the event: a guided tour of St Alban's Abbey by Sandy Walkington, the party's prospective parliamentary candidate for St Albans. The anonymous buyer paid £20 for the experience and described it as 'very good'. Colchester, then called Camulodunum, was a key stronghold in the empire of Ancient Rome. In AD41 it was the subject of a fierce battle to control Britain by the Roman emperor Claudius. In 2005 archeologists unearthed the remains of a walled structure more than 1,000ft long which was believed to be a Roman circus or chariot racing arena. One of several Roman finds in the city, it was the only verified example of a Roman circus in Britain. Colchester Castle, Essex, one of the many historic sites which would have delighted visitors on Sir Bob's tour .",

         "Amir Khan has hit back at insults from America’s flamboyant world champion Floyd Mayweather by claiming he is more famous than the welterweight known as the best pound-for-pound fighter on the planet. And in a neat dig at Mayweather’s famed macho ego, Khan insisted he throws more punches in one round than the unbeaten world champion manages in an entire fight. Mayweather, who has earned £300million in a unbeaten 47-fight career, is looking for a super-fight with Manny Pacquiao and dismissed Khan’s plea to fight him by claiming the Bolton fighter’s ‘name doesn’t carry enough weight’. Amir Khan has announced that he will donate the £30,000 shorts he wore during his last week to charity . Khan posted two pictures of his refurbished gym and clothes from his fight with Devon Alexander on Thursday . But Khan, back in his native North West after beating Devon Alexander in Las Vegas at the weekend, was in fighting form as he held court at The Gloves Community Centre boxing gym in his hometown. ‘Mayweather says I’m not a big enough name but I am a bigger name than his opponents Maidana, Guerrero and Victor Ortiz put together. ‘I am known in places like India, Pakistan, Dubai and the UAE where they don’t even know who Mayweather is. India has a billion people, Pakistan has 180m people and I can’t even walk down the street there. I am bigger than Mayweather in a lot of places and I can help him become more famous, and earn more money.’ Khan isn’t worried that 36-year-old Mayweather could catch him out. Khan was all smiles as he talked to the assembled press at his gym in Bolton . Khan is hoping his next fight will be against Floyd Mayweather next year . ‘Mayweather throws maybe three hundred punches in a fight, I could manage that in a single round,’ he said. ‘Floyd will never hurt me. I have been knocked down in other fights but Mayweather is not the biggest puncher, not as big as Alexander. Our fight would be like a game of chess, hit-move. It would be about footwork and accuracy, nothing more, nothing less. ‘I speak to legends like Roy Jones and Thomas Hearns and they say I would beat him. Even the taxi driver I spoke to in Vegas said he hoped I would knock him out. The people there want to see him humbled . ‘But Floyd is the boss. If he doesn’t want to fight me, he won’t. He’s not the type of guy where I could just turn up to his house and have a chat about it. But maybe all this stuff about me not being a big name is a sign he might be interested, he is starting to promote the fight. I don’t think him and Pacquiao will happen.’ Khan’s homecoming to England after wowing the Vegas fans has been bittersweet. His friend Anthony Crolla, who trains in the same gym, suffered a fractured skull and broken ankle after being hit on the head by a concrete slab as he confronted burglars. Khan lands a left hand during his impressive win on decision against Alexander . Khan arrived back in Manchester along with his wife and daughter on Wednesday . Mayweather says Khan's 'name holds no weight' and that he will not fight him . And the terrorist attack that killed 132 schoolchildren in Pakistan, where Khan’s family originate from, has also affected him badly. The £30,000 pair of shorts he wore at the weekend, containing a gold waistband, will be auctioned off to raise funds for the survivors. Talking about Crolla, Khan revealed that he had volunteered to be his pal’s sparring partner ahead of his world lightweight title shot against Richar Abril in Manchester on January 23, which has now been cancelled . ‘Me and Crolla are good friends,’ said Khan. ‘I roomed with him as an amateur. ‘His trainer Joe Gallagher was at my fight in Vegas and I told him I would spar with Crollar to help him because Abril is a long fighter, and I have got long arms, I can replicate his style. It is probable that Mayweather will insist on fighting Pacquiao, an eight-division champion, in his adopted hometown of Las Vegas . FLOYD MAYWEATHER . Age 37 . Born Michigan, USA . Professional debut October 11, 1996 . Fights 47 . Wins 47 . Knockouts 26 . Losses 0 . Draws 0 . MANNY PACQUIAO . Age 36 . Born Bukidnon, Phillipines . Professional debut January 22, 1995 .

Draws 0 . ‘Then I got back and found he had been smashed over the head. I feel really bad, they have taken away his dream of fighting for a world title and tried to ruin his life, over nothing.’ Khan admits there must be doubts over whether Crolla can fight again. ‘When you have suffered something that bad, you have to understand the Board might not give him a license. It is very dangerous, is it worth that risk? ‘We fighters, even me in his position, would want to fight again, but sometimes you have to think of your health first.’ The attack on Crolla follows a knife attack on another potential Khan opponent, Kell Brook, in Tenerife earlier this year. The two incidents were totally unconnected but Khan says he is always conscious of trying to stay away from trouble outside boxing. ‘I don’t like fighting, I only do it when I am in the ring,’ he said.",

         "Clearly Jesus was sexy. After all, He is the Son of God. I don't mean to be disrespectful, but as I watched the trailer for the new movie, \"Son of God,\" I found myself gawking at the actor portraying Jesus. Diogo Morgado is one hot dude. His Jesus looks more like Brad Pitt than that nice man with the beard in all those paintings. I'm not the only one gawking at Morgodo's Jesus. He inspired the hashtag, \"#HotJesus\". It went viral on Twitter. The actor told The New York Times he doesn't want his looks to distract from the movie, but, \"If the message of Jesus was love, hope and compassion, and I can bring that to more people by being a more appealing Jesus, I am happy with that.\" Clearly we have a new trend. A \"more appealing\" Jesus is not just a better prophet, he's ... sexy. We actually don't know what Jesus looked like. We do know he was a carpenter, so perhaps Jesus was buff. But, I don't think when the Biblical Nathaniel asked, \"Nazareth! Can anything good come from there?\" and Phillip answered, \"Come and see,\" they were talking about Jesus' beautiful face or chiseled abs. Yes, Jesus, as portrayed in countless paintings, has a six-pack. As comedian and author, Greg Behrendt joked, \"I'd like to get ripped ... ripped like Jesus. Jesus was ripped. You've seen the pictures, right? He's ripped! Ripped. He's the son of God. He's not going to be walking around saying I've got back fat today, I'm so puffy.\" All joking aside, why must Jesus be sexy? Or ripped? Or even handsome? The Rev. Robert B. Lawton, SJ, a Jesuit priest and former president of Loyola Marymount University, says, \"There is absolutely no indication that Jesus was good-looking and sexy. In fact there is a passage in the prophet Isaiah that is taken as referring to Jesus. It says this: . \"He had no form or majesty that we should look at him/nothing in his appearance that we should desire him. He was despised and rejected by others; a man of suffering and acquainted with infirmity; and as one from whom others hide their faces he was despised, and we held him of no account.\" (Isaiah 53. 2-3.) While this might not be conclusive evidence, it's quite possible that Jesus was no Jewish Brad Pitt from Palestine. On the other hand, why wouldn't God create a perfect Son? \"Anything that is sexy is going to attract people. People who might not go to the movie might want to check it out, particularly non-Christians,\" says the Rev. Lisa Jenkins, senior pastor of St. Matthew's Baptist Church in Harlem. \"I don't see a problem with Jesus being attractive given our cultural context,\" she says. \"I don't recall a Jesus who was not appealing to the eye. That's Hollywood.\" Jenkins is more concerned about what she considers an inaccurate portrayal of Jesus' ethnicity. The Rev. James Martin, SJ, editor-at-large for America Magazine, and author of the coming book, \"Jesus: A Pilgrimage,\" agrees. \"God did not choose to incarnate himself in Laguna Beach,\" he says. \"He chose to incarnate Himself at a certain place, at a certain time in a certain person.\" And that person was a Palestinian Jew. \"Many people have a hard time with the humanity of Jesus ... the closer He is to human physical perfection, the easier it is for some to accept Him.\" But, Martin says, there is a danger in that too. A physically perfect Jesus makes Him into a God pretending to be man. When Jesus was both human and divine. \"He was like us in all things, except sin, as the theology goes,\" Martin says. \"That means, He had a body, He got sick, He got tired, He may have sprained an ankle or two. There are passages in the Gospel showing Him falling asleep because He was tired. We tend to airbrush the physical imperfections away.\" Those traits make Jesus so much more accessible. So much more ... human. I tried to come up with a living person to compare to Jesus. That, of course, is impossible. The closest I can come, as a Catholic, is Pope Francis. I've grown to revere him. Is it because he's sexy? In a word: No.",

         "By . Rachel Quigley . Last updated at 6:52 PM on 10th July 2011 . Theirs is more than just your average boy-meets-girl story. It's a New York love story, with a very modern twist. Allen Sheinman, 58, and his wife Collette Stallone, 56, said they know the secret to a happy and successful marriage - live in separate homes. For the first four years of wedded bliss the quirky couple - who met online - lived apart, she in Greenwich Village and he in West 23rd street in Manhattan. Secret: Collette Stallone said she believes marriage is a state of mind and doesn't see why two people have to live together . Force: Allen Sheinman said he didn't want to both get married and lived together but the recession drove them to cohabit . Allen - a managing editor at a trade publication - said: 'We consider seventh avenue a long hallway between our two domiciles.' But hard times hit as it did with many New Yorkers and when Allen's boss raised his rent to $1,800 a month, the couple did the unthinkable - they moved in together. Allen said: 'It was really a financial move to cohabit. Now we are transitioning into real-time marriage. This is it.' Speaking about living together - or not living together - Allen said it was an arrangement they were both comfortable with. He said: 'I told her I could handle getting married and living together, just not both. And to my relief she said, \"OK let's get married and keep our own places\". That's what I was hoping for.' Colette said: 'When you're young you think, \"Oh, . we’re in love,\" all that. But when you get older, you say, \"You know, I . love you, but I need my space\".' Expensive: Allen leaves his spacious apartment on West 23rd street because the rent was increased to $1,800 . Tight squeeze: There is barely room for Collette's stuff in her Greenwich Village apartment nevermind her husbands . When Allen moved into Colette's tiny one-bedroom Greenwich Village apartment, where she has been for 31 years, even then they weren't prepared to fully live together. Instead of embracing cohabitation, the couple drew up battle lines, put up invisible walls and lay down a set of ground rules. According to the New York Post, there was no crossing into each other's space without permission, she had her own bedroom - where she generously said he could sleep at weekends - and he slept in a sofa bed in the living room. The end?: The couple are still blissfully in love after four years of marriage and living apart but will cohabiting change that? They have their own newspaper and magazine subscriptions,' watch their own TV shows from their own space and even have a shower rota. The kitchen - which also hosts the apartment's only shower - is the only place that is allowed for both couples any time of the day or night. Colette - a retired high-school teacher who now runs her home-made jewellery business - believes that not living together was the secret to their happy marriage. 'Getting married is a state of mind, I don't see why we have to live together. I don't need to see him brush his teeth,' she told the Post. 'It's bad enough I see him brush his hair. 'I don’t know where this idea came from that you always have to be in the middle of whatever the other person is doing.' Alarmingly, she said when she told her ex-husband they were now living together he said: 'I give it four months.' The couple are featured in a documentary titled 'Two's a crowd' which will have its New York premiere at the Rooftop Films Summer Series on July 21.",

         "By . Associated Press . and Reuters . Honey mixed with sugar might be sweet, but it is not 'honey.' The Food and Drug Administration is taking steps to ensure that shoppers who buy honey are getting the real deal. New guidance issued Tuesday would prevent food companies from adding sugar or other sweeteners to pure honey and still calling it 'honey.' Funny honey: The Food and Drug Administration is taking steps to ensure that shoppers who buy honey are getting the real deal . The agency said enforcement action is possible against U.S. food businesses or importers if companies try to cut those sweeteners into real honey and do not label the product correctly. If those sweeteners are added, the label should read 'blend of sugar and honey' or 'blend of honey and corn syrup.' The FDA regularly detains honey imports and tests them after finding drug residues and unlabeled added sweeteners. Only manufactures that do not add sugar, corn syrup or other sweeteners should label their products as pure 'honey,' the FDA said in draft guidelines posted online. The proposal aims 'to advise the regulated food industry on the proper labeling of honey and honey products to help ensure that honey and honey products are not adulterated or misbranded,' the agency wrote. Americans consume more than 400 million pounds of honey each year, according to U.S. government and industry estimates. New rules: The guidance, released Tuesday, would stop food companies from putting sugar or other sweeteners into pure honey and still referring to it as honey .

         "By . Lizzie Edmonds . William Henry Welch, 53, escaped punishment for driving without licence because his wife incorrectly told him he would be covered if he borrowed a friend's car . A star of My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding escaped punishment for driving without insurance after his wife checked his documentation as he can 'barely read', a court heard. William Henry Welch, 53, avoided six penalty points on his driving licence because his wife incorrectly told him he would be covered if he borrowed a friend's car, a court was told. Welch told Magistrates he asked his wife to look at his documents as he struggles with reading. He was granted an absolute discharge after admitting driving without insurance at Newton Aycliffe Magistrates' Court. Welch is a well-known campaigner for traveller and gipsy rights - and has appeared on My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding among other reality shows. Speaking after the case Welch said: 'It isn’t all doom and gloom when you go to these courts, if you go and you have a reasonable argument the magistrates are willing to listen. 'You should never just give up and think that they won’t listen to you because they will.' The court heard how Welch’s own car had broken down when he was working in Leominster, Herefordshire, and a friend loaned him a Vauxhall Vectra to drive back home. Welch told the court he had rung his wife, Rachel, to check he was covered to drive the Vectra. After reading the insurance policy she told him that he was. Welch of Darlington, Durham, told the court he left insurance documents to his wife because: 'I can barely read.' Mrs Welch, 49, told the court: 'We were both named on the insurance document and so I thought we were both policy holders.' Andrea Milson, prosecuting, told the court that as policyholder, Mrs Welch was covered to drive any car. However, as Mr Welch was a named driver he was only covered to drive the family car and not the borrowed Vectra. Welch, a well-known Gypsy campaigner, told the court he asked his wife to look at his documentation as he can 'barely read'. He has starred in numerous television shows including My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding . The car was stopped by police on the A456 in Worcestershire last August and Welch was subsequently charged with driving with no insurance and no MoT. Welch admitted both charges but, in a rare ‘special reasons hearing’, his solicitor, David Dedman, argued that the licence should not be endorsed with the usual six penalty points. 'This was an honest mistake,' said Mr Dedman. 'He genuinely believed he was insured and was misled by his wife, not deliberately or intentionally.' Magistrates granted Welch an absolute discharge on the matter of no insurance. They imposed no penalty points, but he was ordered to pay costs of £85. He was fined a further £100 for the offence of driving a vehicle with no MoT test certificate. Paddy Doherty walked free from court after headbutting his stepbrother in March . In March, Paddy Doherty, 55, walked free from court after admitting he headbutted his stepbrother. The 55-year-old breached the terms of a suspended jail sentence when he committed the assault at a pub in Flintshire, north Wales, in October 2013. He was given a six-month supervision order instead of jail time. The 2011 winner of Celebrity Big Brother had previously been handed a 31-week jail term, suspended for two years, in January 2012, after he brawled in the street with a fellow traveller. The show's infamous dressmaker Thelma Madine was sued by her head designer for unfair dismissal at the end of 2013. A court ruled Ms Madine dismissed Leanne Phillips, who was paid £400 a week to design dresses for the Nico Bridal Company, based in Liverpool, after a heated row. Ms Madine fired the 31-year-old, who she had previously praised with taking her business to 'another level' after six years.",

         "(CNN) -- Investigators Wednesday exhumed the body of a 7-year-old Illinois girl slain more than five decades ago in hopes that modern science will bolster the case against the man now accused of killing her. The remains of Maria Ridulph, dead since 1957, were exhumed for tests as the 71-year-old suspect in her killing was headed back to Illinois from Seattle, DeKalb County State's Attorney Clay Campbell told reporters. \"Suffice to say science has advanced greatly, thankfully, since that time and we're hoping that advancement in science can assist us in our investigation of this case,\" Campbell said. Ridulph disappeared while playing with a friend near her home in Sycamore, Illinois, about 60 miles west of Chicago. Her body was found five months later and 120 miles away. Jack Daniel McCullough, the man now facing murder charges in her death, was an early suspect in the disappearance but had an alibi: He told police that he was at a military recruiting station in Rockford, Illinois, about 20 miles away, the evening Ridulph was reported missing. McCullough told investigators he had been given a train ticket from Rockford to Chicago by the military, then returned home and went on a date with his girlfriend. But when police interviewed the woman again in 2010 and asked if she had any photos of McCullough, she discovered an unused train ticket from Rockford to Chicago that she said he had given her on the date of the crime. The discovery led to McCullough's arrest in Seattle in early July. Campbell said Wednesday that McCullough was en route to Illinois from Washington state to face murder charges in Ridulph's death. Maria's brother, Charles Ridulph, appeared at a news conference with Campbell and said the family had agreed to the exhumation. \"Although the events were very difficult and very unsettling, we understand the necessity for these things, and we are in complete agreement and thankful for the way this case is being handled,\" he said.",

         "By . Mark Duell . UPDATED: . 17:06 EST, 3 March 2012 . Rush Limbaugh has continued his attack on a student he branded a 'slut' for her views on contraception despite being ditched by advertisers and criticized by the President. On his radio show yesterday, the 61-year-old defended his comments which have caused widespread outrage and went on to suggest that Ms Fluke 'had boyfriends lined up around the block. Or they would have been in my day'. He said: 'She's having so much sex that she's going broke, she says... You're worried here that I'm just stepping in it deeper, yes you are but this is the truth.' On Friday three advertisers revealed they will pull all adverts from the radio show after the host had made fun of Ms Fluke for saying religious institutions should cover birth control in health insurance - and said in a further show that she should have to make sex tapes if this ever happens. Scroll down for audio clip . Rant: Rush Limbaugh, 61, left called Sandra Fluke, right, a student at Catholic college Georgetown University, a 'slut' for saying religious institutions should cover birth control under health insurance . Now mattress retailers Sleep Train . and Sleep Number, as well as mortgage lender QuickenLoans, have all . bowed to pressure on Twitter and said they will no longer advertise on . the show. And Barack Obama . has also weighed in to the row, describing the comment as . 'reprehensible' and calling student Sandra Fluke to discuss the . controversy. ‘We don't condone negative comments . directed toward any group,’ a Sleep Train spokesman tweeted. ‘Thanks to all of you . for your concern and input.’ 'Recent comments by Rush Limbaugh do not align with our values,' a Sleep Number spokesman said. 'So we made decision to immediately suspend all advertising on that program.' A QuickenLoans spokesman said: 'Due to continued inflammatory comments - along with valuable feedback from clients & team members - QL has suspended ads on Rush Limbaugh.' Meanwhile advertiser ProFlowers said it will . 're-evaluate’ its marketing plan and dating site eHarmony insisted it . will look into ‘the matter of 'network buys’. Mr Limbaugh said earlier this week that Ms Fluke, of Catholic college . Georgetown University in Washington D.C., was promiscuous for saying . woman should get the pill for medical reasons. And he went even further on his next show, saying: 'If we are going to pay for your contraceptives and thus pay for you to have sex... we want you to post the videos online so we can all watch.' In addition, Barack Obama said he considered Mr Limbaugh's remarks 'reprehensible' and called Ms Fluke to express his disappointment that she was the subject of 'inappropriate personal attacks'. 'He said he hoped my parents were proud of me,' Ms Fluke said, adding that the President 'thanked me for speaking out and for expressing the concerns of so many women'. Scroll down for audio clip . Angry: Mattress retailer Sleep Train, based in Rocklin, California, has bowed to pressure on Twitter and said it will no longer advertise on the show . Also angry: Another mattress company in Sleep Number also announced through a spokesman that they were 'immediately suspending' all advertising on the Rush Limbaugh show . Out: Quicken Loans also decided to pull advertising from the show after the 'inflammatory comments' 'The fact that our political discourse has become debased in many ways . is bad enough,' a White House spokesman said. 'It is worse when . it's directed at a private citizen simply expressing her . views.' More surprisingly, Mr Limbaugh has also faced criticism from the Republican presidential candidates, with Rick Santorum calling his comments 'absurd'. When Mitt Romney was asked what he thought about the remarks, he replied: 'I'll just say this, which is, it's not the language I would have used.' 'If we are going to pay for your contraceptives and thus pay for you to have sex... we want you to post the videos online so we can all watch' Rush Limbaugh . Mr Limbaugh . said on his original show regarding Ms Fluke's comments on birth . control: ‘What does that make her? It makes her a slut, right? It makes . her a prostitute. She wants . to be paid to have sex. ‘She's having so much sex she can't afford the contraception. She wants you and me and the taxpayers to pay her to have sex.’ Ms Fluke said on Friday that she has been left 'very upset' by the comments made by Mr Limbaugh. 'My reaction was the reaction . a lot of women have had historically when they’ve been called these . types of names,' she told MSNBC. 'Initially to be stunned by it, and then to quickly feel outraged and very upset.' Annoyed: President Barack Obama, seen on Friday, considers Mr Limbaugh's remarks 'reprehensible' and called Ms Fluke to express his disappointment that she was the subject of 'inappropriate personal attacks' Shock: Ms Fluke told MSNBC's Today show on Friday that she was 'stunned and outraged' by the comments . Ms Fluke was due to testify at a . hearing on Capitol Hill last month about Barack Obama's mandate that . health insurers provide contraception. The Senate yesterday defeated a GOP effort to roll back President Barack Obama's policy on contraception insurance coverage. It was the first vote on an issue that has raised controversy on religious and women's rights. The close 51-48 vote killed an amendment to allow employers and insurers to opt out of portions of the President's health care law they found morally objectionable. But committee chairman Darrell Issa of . California said she could not testify at the hearing as it was focused . on threats to religious freedom. Ms Fluke later put her testimony on . YouTube and spoke about a friend who had to take birth control to treat a . disorder that caused ovarian cysts. The friend subsequently lost her . ovary. She also spoke of classmates who can’t afford contraception, . which was what really riled Mr Limbaugh. Ms Fluke claimed a female student spends $3,000 on protected sex during a three-year course at university, reported ABC News. ‘Three thousand dollars for birth . control in three years? That’s $1,000 a year of sex - and, she wants us . to pay for it,’ Mr Limbaugh said. Spokesman: Ms Fluke was due to testify at a hearing on Capitol Hill last month about Barack Obama's mandate that health insurers provide contraception - but she wasn't allowed to do so . Another target: Mr Limbaugh also hit out at NASCAR driver Danica Patrick earlier this week on Monday for backing contraceptive insurance coverage . 'She's having so much sex she can't . afford her own birth control pills and she agrees that Obama should . provide them, or the Pope.’ Should U.S. university students' health insurance cover birth control costs?

         "By . Katy Winter . PUBLISHED: . 08:09 EST, 20 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 08:48 EST, 20 December 2013 . A mother has shed more than half her body weight for the festive season after being disgusted by a photo taken at a Christmas party last year. Carol Bryant, 42, from Brighton, was 'horrified' by her 21 stone frame when she saw a photo of herself socialising with a friend. The full-time mother vowed to shed the weight in time for the following festive season - and this year she will be rewarded for her efforts as she can host her own Christmas party as a svelte size 12. 'I looked like a Christmas pudding': Carol Bryant, right, said she was was horrified when she saw this picture of herself at a Christmas party last year . Slim: Carol has now dropped from 21 stone to 9 stone 10lbs and a trim size 12 after going on an extreme diet . She said: 'I was mortified when the photo went up on Facebook. l didn't even recognise myself at first, I looked like a Christmas pudding.' Determined to change her ways, in January 2013 she decided to try a meal replacement programme which limits your daily calorie intake to just 500 calories each day. 'I knew I had to do something about my weight,' she explained. Ian Marber, nutritionist says: 'The diets are monitored and so are considered safe for that reason. 'But very low calorie diets are not to be undertaken in the long term without supervision and also, importantly, clearance from your GP. 'It's what you eat after the diet has finished that's vital and I recommend seeing a nutrition professional afterwards to learn how to eat, not how to diet.' 'I was absolutely massive and I was terrified I would have a heart attack. 'Not to mention how awful I looked in photographs next to my slim friends. 'I was so jealous of all the fashionable clothes they got to wear, while I was stuck in frumpy t-shirts and baggy trousers.' After sticking to the plan for a . year, Carol has shed 12 stone and gone from a size 28 to a trim . size 12 in time for Christmas. 'This year there will be no hiding at Christmas parties for me,' said proud Carol. 'I've already picked out a gorgeous, shimmering size-12 dress to show off my trim, new figure. And I feel incredible.' Devastated by seeing herself in the photos Carol vowed to boycott Christmas parties until she lost the weight . Unsurprisingly, Carol's 5000 calorie-a-day diet saw her weight balloon from 15 stone and a size 16, to a massive 21 stone and a size 28 . 'No role model': Carol quit her job working in an office to become a full-time mother to Lois, now six, pictured, but found herself spending a lot of time on the sofa . Carol had always struggled with her weight. When she was in her teens she was a size 16, then in 2007 after having her daughter Lois, now six, she piled on more pounds. This year she will be rewarded for her efforts and hosting her own Christmas party as a svelte size 12 . She quit her job working in an office to become a full-time mother, but would spend her days sat on the sofa gorging on greasy take-aways, fatty chocolates and salty crisps. Unsurprisingly, her 5000 calorie-a-day diet saw her weight balloon from 15 stone and a size 16, to a massive 21 stone and a size 28. Carol says: 'It was disgusting how large I got, and I was no role model for my little girl. I was constantly hungry and would shovel platefuls of food down my throat without even thinking. It was an addiction.' But within the first two weeks of her diet, Carol had lost an incredible 24Ibs. 'The weight was just falling off of me,' she said. 'It was an amazing feeling and it spurned me on to lose more weight.' Carol also began walking every day so she now she weighs in at just 9st 10Ibs, dress size 12. Instead of having the meal replacements, she's now joined Slimming World so she can sustain her weightloss and said she's never felt more confident. 'This year I can't wait to show off my party dress,' she said. 'I won't be hiding away in the corner, I want to be the centre of attention. I want to party my way through the celebrations, making up for all those lost years.' Breakfast: Four slices of white toast, buttered . Lunch: White bread cheese sandwich with crisps, soda . Dinner: Doner Kebab with chips . Snacks: White toast with butter, crisps, chocolate, block of cheese . Breakfast: Fruit smoothie . Lunch: Vegetable soup, brown bread . Dinner: Quorn chilli with brown rice and vegetables . Snacks: Fruit, plain yogurt .",

         "By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 19:58 EST, 30 April 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 20:11 EST, 30 April 2012 . A 22-year-old man who allegedly went on a gruesome murder spree has baffled cops as they try to figure out what drove him to carry out the attacks. Bryan Clay was charged in the savage killing of a mom and daughter in Las Vegas after a week-long man hunt. He is alleged to have bludgeoned to death 10-year-old Karla Martinez and her mother, Ignacia Martinez at their Robin Street home last Saturday, in an apparent random crime. Savage: Brian Clay allegedly bludgeoned to death the mother and daughter at their Las Vegas home . Karla’s father, Arturo Martinez, 39, was critically injured in the bludgeoning attack and remains in hospital with head injuries. 'We believe this was a stranger, a random savage act,' Lt. Ray Steiber of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police's homicide division said at a news conference. 'I've been doing this 24 years and this is the case you hope you never see.' Ignacia and Arturo’s 9-year-old son . tragically discovered the slain bodies of his mother and sister, going . into school and telling teachers at his Mabel Hoggard Elementary School . that they had been killed by his dad. Police later rejected the . allegation and have since then been combing through the 'nightmare' crime scene house which they said has blood in every room. Lt. Lundquist said: ‘This is the . kind of case that goes on that they write movies about and I don’t say . that as to be an entertainment factor. 'I'm saying this was a savage, . heinous crime.’ Karla had been raped prior to her . death, Las Vegas Metro police said in a press conference on Friday. While officers tried to piece together the events leading up to the murders, they said Clay had carried out a separate sexual assault, against a . 50-year-old woman the day before the bloody murders. Metro Lt. Rob Lundquist said Clay . began chasing the woman at around 2am on April 15, grabing her and . dragging her into a desert area and violently attacking her in what . became a sexual assault. 'We're talking about a 50-year-old woman who was attacked, brutally attacked, and she was sexually assaulted,' Steiber said. 'We're talking about a family who was in their home and unbeknownst to them, a savage intruder enters that home and attacks three people.' Scroll down for video . Murdered: Police found the bodies of Ignacia Martinez, left, and her daughter Karla, right, who had also been raped in the brutal attack . House of horrors: Police collected evidence from the Las Vegas home where the bodies of Ignacia and Karla Martinez were found on Monday . Police said they are treating the . crimes as unrelated and do not believe Clay had any relationship with . his victims prior to the attacks. 'They believe that this was a . stranger, no way connected to the family or with the other victim,' Officer Laura Meltzer told ABCNews.com. 'He is in custody and will . not be getting back out.' Officers launched a thorough investigation of the crime scene, with up to 60 officers working on the case at one stage. Clay was arrested on a child abuse charge and is to be re-booked as soon as possible on charges of sexual assault and murder. The murders have sent shockwaves . through the community, especially at the Real KO Boxing Club in North . Las Vegas, where both Arturo and Ignacia Martinez worked and were viewed . as positive role models. Those who knew them say that the couple, both trained fighters, would not have gone quietly if attacked or robbed. Felipe Lazos, a 16-year-old who trained at Real KO Boxing, told the Review-Journal that the attacker would have 'had to be a good fighter'. Harrowing: Crime scene investigators examine the scene of a home where the bodies of Ignacia and Karla Martinez were found on Monday in Las Vegas . Police have arrested Bryan Clay in the brutal rape and murder of Karla Martinez, left. Her father Arturo, right, was found in the home severely beaten - but alive . Tragic: Las Vegas Coroner Michael Murphy, left, helps load a gurney holding one of the victims into the back of a truck . Neighbor Lucinda Jackson-Griffin said . she had never heard disturbances at the home until she was woken by . gunshots on Monday morning, but police are now saying that a gun was not . used in the killings. Another, Juliana Maqueda-Perez, . said she heard a man screaming in English and a child crying in the . early hours of the morning, the Review-Journal reported. 'I walked past there every day,' neighbor Dick Webb, 82, said about the house. He said he had walked past the house less than 90 minutes before the boy arrived at school but hadn't seen anything amiss. Police originally blocked the area around the single-story stucco home to await a warrant to enter and retrieve the bodies. Two dead: Police found the bodies of Ignacia and Karla Martinez - who had also been raped - and an unharmed 4-year-old boy at the Las Vegas home . Double slaying: Las Vegas police are questioning a man found covered in blood at a home where a 9-year-old boy told school officials his mother and sister were dead . Animal control officers arrived to remove a dog from the house. An . officer said it was not harmed but had been taken away as no one was . there to care for it. School . Principal Celese Rayford declined to comment, and Clark County School . District spokeswomen provided no immediate information about the student . or whether the other 457 students in grades kindergarten through 5 were . told about the case. Police said the two surviving children from the attack remain with Child Protective Services. Friend and next-door neighbour Mark Groenert told Fox 5 Vegas: 'It's so sad. I knew them all. And it's sad and tragic'. Horrified: Authorities believe the boy was in a state of shock when he told teachers at nearby Hoggard Elementary School about the scene at his home .

         "Sporting only the most stylish designer labels, wearing only meticulously matched colors, the Congo's dandies are the very embodiment of sartorial elegance. Known as \"Sapeurs,\" these dapper dressers are a Congolese subculture devoted to the cult of style. In Brazzaville and Kinshasa -- the capitals of neighboring Republic of the Congo and the Democratic Republic of the Congo -- they stand out among the widespread poverty, strutting the streets like walking works of art. \"It's the fetishization of fashion -- they are the worshippers of fashion, it's their god, it's powerful,\" says Didier Gondola, author of \"History of the Congo,\" who has extensively researched the Sapeurs. But for the Sapeurs -- who are almost always men -- it's not about what's in vogue, it's about style. The labels they covet most are those that evoke classic elegance. Suits by Yves Saint Laurent, Jean Paul Gaultier and Armani are all in demand, as are Japanese labels Kenzo and Yamamoto, says Gondola. When it comes to shoes, exclusive French label Weston and British label Church's reign supreme. And imitations will not be tolerated. \"You can lose your reputation if you are wearing imitation,\" says Gondola. \"That's something blasphemous.\" See also: Desert festival: Oasis for sounds of the Sahara . But these labels don't come cheap. Gondola, who was born in the Congo and teaches history at Indiana University in the United States, explains that Sapeurs aren't rich; they typically work menial jobs, and have been known to resort to shoplifting to feed their addiction to apparel. In Brazzaville, it's common for Sapeurs to rent or borrow clothes from fellow fops or requisition them from friends visiting from Europe. As the Congolese Diaspora has spread, so have the Sapeurs. They can now be found in European capitals including London, Brussels and Paris. Dixy Ndalla, 30, was born and raised in Brazzaville, but has lived in London since the age of 17. He's infatuated with the classic cuts worn by the British aristocracy and can spend £1,000 a month on new shirts and jackets. \"I am very passionate about clothing, I'm passionate about colors and suits,\" he says. \"In the winter it's anything to do with tweeds, in the summertime a nice blazer, a beautiful pair of jeans, a beautiful shirt. \"I especially love Hackett, one of the top designers in the UK ... Hackett suits start from around £600 and a bespoke made-to-measure will go out from £1,000 and upward.\" Ndalla travels back to Brazzaville in the summer and takes pride in showing off his very British attire. \"In the summer holidays, everyone goes to show their outfits,\" he says. \"They all meet in one street or bars and they all show their colors or the label of their suits ... it's up to people to judge and appreciate who's dressed well.\" Once dressed in their finery, Brazzaville's Sapeurs will often head to \"Le Main Bleu,\" a favorite bar, where they have informal contests. Each tries to out Sap each other with their combination of style, comportment and designer labels -- known as \"griffes.\" But Ndalla doesn't consider himself a Sapeur, because he doesn't dress up to compete with others. For him, it's simply about taking pride in what you wear. \"People from Congo love to dress up -- it's something that's in my blood,\" he says. Although every Sapeur has their own unique style, certain looks are especially popular. Pastel-colored three-piece suits are a staple of the Sapeurs' fastidiously assembled ensembles. They are finished off with a tie, cravat or bow tie -- and the obligatory pocket square protruding from their immaculately tailored jackets. Cigars and pipes -- lit or unlit -- are de rigueur. Italian photographer Daniele Tamagni stumbled across the Sapeurs when he travelled to Brazzaville in 2007. The next year he returned to photograph them, collecting his images in the book \"Gentlemen of Bacongo.\" He says individuals often belong to sub groups within the Sapeur culture, such as the Piccadilly group, who dress in Scottish kilts. \"One member has a sister in Scotland who brings him kilts,\" he explains. \"They use and they adapt to their taste and individuality. They are masters of style, they create their own style.\" See also: Congo's erupting volcano boosts tourism . Some disapprove of the Sapeurs spending what little money they have on the frivolities of fashion. But Gondola argues that being a Sapeur isn't just about vanity -- it's a political statement. In the 1970s \"authenticity\" was part of the state ideology in the DRC -- a policy that prohibited the wearing of Western suits. The Sapeurs rebelled by wearing aggressively non-conformist clothes, including leather suits, says Gondola. To this day Kinshasa's Sapeurs dress less conservatively than their suit-sporting Brazzaville brethren. \"The Sapeur is also about masculinity, politics, changing the stereotypes about how people view Africa,\" says Gondola. \"It's about a lot of things, about beating the West at its own game, which is fashion: 'You colonized us but we dress better than you.'\" Gondola says the history of the Sapeurs can be traced back to the 19th century, when the Republic of the Congo was a French colony. Some colonial masters would pay their servants in used clothes, and those servants would make a show of wearing their masters' clothes on Sundays. He adds that the phenomenon grew in the 1920s and 30s among Congolese nationals living in Paris -- in particular Sap pioneer and anti-colonial activist André Matswa. But it really took off after independence in 1960, when ordinary Congolese people would travel to Paris and return home wearing the latest fashions. In the 1970s, popular musician Papa Wemba, from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (formerly Zaire), began promoting the idea of the Sapeur, forming the \"Société des Ambianceurs et Persons Élégants,\" or SAPE, of which many modern-day Sapeurs claim membership. So what is the enduring appeal of the Sapeur? \"It's politics, spiritual, aesthetic, social -- so many things,\" says Gondola. \"It's a whole science -- they are artists.\"",

         "By . Becky Evans . PUBLISHED: . 10:22 EST, 6 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 11:56 EST, 6 August 2013 . The spate of terrifying night-time rapes in an isolated, orthodox Christian community went on for four years and yet the victims could barely remember the ordeal and many believed they had dreamed it. It was not until 2009 that nine men were eventually convicted of the rape of more than 100 women and girls in their own homes in the Mennonite Manitoba Colony in Bolivia. But despite the convictions, it has emerged that the sexual attacks in the closed community are continuing. More than 100 women and girls were raped in the Mennonite Manitoba Colony in Bolivia but despite the convictions four years ago residents have admitted that the sexual assaults have continued (file picture) An investigation has uncovered that once more women and youngsters in the Old Colony, where motorised vehicles and electricity are banned, are suffering sexual assaults they can barely remember. Vice.com has found that many families believe the assaults are continuing despite the men, aged 19 to 43, being jailed. But members of the closed community told Vice . that without cameras or streetlights - both forbidden in the community - or a police force, they have no way to stop or catch the rapists. They say they will have to wait until someone is caught in the act and in the meantime increase security at their homes. One husband, whose wife was raped in the first spate of attacks, told Vice.com: 'It's definitely not as frequent.  are being much more careful than before, but it still goes on.' From 2005 to 2009, women complained that they regularly woke up to intense pain and semen and blood on their sheets but their claims were not initially investigated and they were not believed. Some even reported waking up to find rope tied to their wrists or ankles or dirty fingerprints on their bodies but the victims could not remember the previous night. Many women had hazy memories or images of at least one man on top of them but they were not able to resist. Residents say they have heard repeated rumours that the night-time rapes have continued but because the closed community does not have a police force the alleged crimes are unlikely to be investigated (file picture) The Manitoba Colony in eastern Bolivia is home to about 3,000 people . The eventual trial found that the attackers used a powerful sedative to drug whole families before carrying out the rapes. Many . women were attacked as they lay next to their husbands, who were also . knocked unconscious by the narcotic. A girl of just three was among the victims and a woman of 60 years old. A pregnant woman gave birth at just six and a half months after being raped while unconscious. Young girls were taken to hospital the next morning suffering from terrible pain and bleeding. The gang of men, who had led some women to believe they were repeatedly attacked by demons, were eventually caught and jailed in 2009. Two of the men were found trying to break into a house and their story unraveled. Each of the nine-strong gang were jailed for 25 years and a vet who supplied the anaesthetic - made from a cow tranquilizer - was sentenced to 12 years. The colony - about 94 miles from Santa Cruz and home to about 3,000 ultraconservative Mennonites - has been deeply scarred by the scandal. Sara Guenter told Vice that she tried to stay awake and asked a trusted worker to guard the house but the attacks continued when no one was watching her home. She said: 'It happened so many times, I lost count.' Some residents initially believed the rape claims were concocted to hide affairs while others believed it was down to 'wild female imagination.' Electricity is banned in the Old . Colonies and the community lives off the land. Men and women's roles are . strictly segregated with men working as farmers and given extra education whereas . women only are responsible for cleaning and cooking. The community has no police force so no one investigated the claims until two men were finally caught trying to break into a neighbour's house. Before that there had been no investigation and the authorities were accused of turning a blind eye to the situation. Abraham Walls Enns, Manitoba Colony's civic leader told Vice: 'That's all behind us now. We'd rather forget than have it be at the forefront of our minds. 'We only knew that something strange was happening in the night. 'But we didn't know who was doing it, so how could we stop it?' Offers of help from outside of the colony, including from more liberal Mennonite communities in Canada and elsewhere, were rejected. Orders for psychological help for victims has also never materialised. Old Colony Mennonites do not use motorised vehicles or electricity . Mennonites are Christians that can be traced from Protestant groups on Europe. They follow the teachings of 16th Century priest Menno Simons, who gave the group his name. There are about 1.7million Mennonites in 82 countries, with prominent communities in Canada, the U.S., Ethiopia, India, and parts of south and central America including Bolivia, Mexico and Paraguay. Almost 400,000 Mennonites live in the U.S. with more than 220,000 living in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The vast majority of Bolivia's Mennonite population are ultraconservative. Over the centuries, members have been severely persecuted and partially due to their pacifism Mennonites fled to other lands where they were tolerated. In the Old Colonies, motorised vehicles, electricity, dance and sport are all banned. Old Order Mennonites tend to use horse and buggies for transportation and speak in a German dialect.",

         "(CNN) -- Premier League big-spenders Manchester City will renew their search for a new world-class striker after ending their interest in Barcelona striker Samuel Eto'o. Eto'o will not be playing for Manchester City next season after the English club ended their interest in him. The Cameroon international, who is about to embark on the last year of his contract at the Nou Camp, felt he should receive a significant portion of the £18million ($29m) fee City were willing to pay -- as he would be entitled to leave for nothing next summer.

         "(CNN) -- A judge Friday upheld a Cleveland, Ohio, jury's recommendation that convicted serial killer Anthony Sowell be sentenced to death. Jurors convicted Sowell of 11 counts of aggravated murder and more than 70 other charges, including abusing corpses and kidnapping. Wednesday, they recommended the death penalty. The convictions ended a saga that began in October 2009 with the discovery of the first two victims' remains inside Sowell's home in Cleveland. He eventually was accused of killing at least 11 women ranging in age from 25 to 52. Cuyahoga County Judge Dick Ambrose imposed the sentence Friday morning. He could have overruled jurors and imposed a life sentence. Sowell, who pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity, had his eyes closed during almost all of Friday's hearing, CNN affiliates reported. He made no comment. Family members of the victims were allowed to make statements. \"Anthony, you will deal with a much higher power for the pain you have caused,\" said Donnita Carmichael, daughter of victim Tonia Carmichael. \"You are an animal and hell awaits your arrival.\" Sowell's lawyers had asked for life in prison. Parole would not have been an option because Sowell, 51, is classified as a \"sexually violent predator.\" During the penalty phase of his trial, Sowell said he was \"sorry.\" \"I know that may not sound like much. But I truly am sorry from the bottom of my heart,\" he said. During his trial, Sowell maintained a candid banter with members of his defense team as he recounted claims of childhood abuse -- both physical and sexual. He grew up in East Cleveland, joined the Marines at age 18 and traveled to California, North Carolina and Japan, authorities said. Sowell served 15 years in prison for attempted rape before being released in 2005. People who met him after his release described him as \"a normal guy.\" He was known locally for selling scrap metal. Sowell's inconspicuous two-story home sat in a dilapidated neighborhood known as Mount Pleasant. A stench hovered around the area, but no one realized it was the scent of decaying human flesh, instead assuming it was a byproduct of a nearby sausage factory. Many of Sowell's victims struggled with drug addiction at some point, and court records showed many resorted to stealing and prostitution to support their habits. The disappearances of the women -- many of whom lived near him -- went largely unnoticed for two years, with only four women being reported missing.",

         "By . Sara Nathan . They have made no secret of their growing love after spending the past few months jet setting around the world together. And one of Michelle Rodriguez's closest confidants has revealed she is so in love with British supermodel Cara Delevingne that she believes she is 'the one' - and wants to start a family with her. In an exclusive interview with MailOnline, the friend of the Fast and Furious . star - who has asked to remain unnamed - reveals how Michelle, 35, is so besotted by Cara, 21, that she . has already told pals she would love a baby with her. But while the actress is planning her future with Cara - who is 14 years younger than her - we can reveal the Mulberry model’s family is terrified of the influence the wayward star is having on the top model who has become the toast of the fashion industry. Scroll down for videos . Inseparable: Before jetting to Italy Cara, 21, and 35-year-old Michelle were seen out on the town in London . The start of something: Model Cara Delevingne shared a kiss . with openly bisexual actress Michelle Rodriguez as they sat courtside at the . New York Knicks game at Madison Square Garden in January. Baring all: Michelle Rodriguez shared a photo on Instagram on Tuesday which showed her stark naked while meditating . The . source, who Michelle regularly confides in, said: 'Michelle comes from . a broken home and it has a lot to do with why she has found herself in . trouble again and again throughout her life. 'Constantly, . she pushes boundaries and has been in trouble with the law, but really . all of it is because she is desperate to be loved. 'Her mom and dad separated when she was a child and ever since Michelle has been yearning for some stability in her life. 'Sadly after years of dating older women and men like Olivier Martinez, nothing seemed to work out for her. 'But now Cara has come along, who is so much younger than the women she normally dates, but suddenly Michelle is happy again.' In . recent years, former Lost star Michelle, who openly admits she is bisexual, has endured a string of broken relationships after dating French heartthrob and S.W.A.T co-star Olivier Martinez, Fast and Furious co-star Vin Diesel as well as model Claudette Lali, director Francesca De Sola and . model Aleksandra Rastovic. The source claims Michelle had a 'great thing' going with Terminator 3 actress Kristanna Loken - who strongly hinted to Advocate magazine that she was in a relationship with her in 2006, yet Michelle has never confirmed their relationship. 'Kristanna wanted to come out as a couple. She's proud to be bisexual, but Michelle wasn't ready to go public,' said the friend: 'So instead of working it out, Michelle ended it. Smitten: Michelle was linked with Terminator 3 actress Kristanna Loken, who hinted the couple were in a relationship in 2006 . Ex-lovers: Michelle Rodriguez iis said to have dated flimmaker Francesca de Sola. The pair are pictured at the screening of Francesca's film 1%ers in New York in April 2013 . 'Then she was left heartbroken a year later when she fell for another model/actress only to find out she had slept with someone else while she was away filming the movie Avatar.' The actress has also found herself behind bars after being in trouble repeatedly with the . law. In March 2002, she was . charged with assault and harassment when her girlfriend, Louise Ward, . claimed the tough girl had attacked her in their New Jersey apartment. Ward was left battered and bruised, but later dropped all charges against Michelle. The friend said: 'Michelle can be intense and dive head first into . romances. This can land her in hot water as she found out with Louise. 'Over the last 15-years there have been countless other examples of her disastrous love life.' Just one year later Michelle found herself in trouble again when she . appeared in court to face eight misdemeanor charges relating to two . driving incidents, including a DUI and a hit and run. In . 2004, she pleaded no contest to three of the charges, hit and run, . drunken driving and driving with a suspended license and went to jail . for 48 hours and was placed on probation for three years. And in 2005, while filming ABC hit Lost in Hawaii, the stunning brunette was fined multiple times for speeding. Later . that year on December 1st she was arrested for drunk driving, to which . she pleaded guilty and paid a $500 fine and spent five days in jail. Due . to this being a clear violation of her earlier drunk driving crimes, . she was also sentenced to 60 days in jail, but due to overcrowding was . released on the same day she entered. And it's precisely this behavior that has left Cara's family a little fearful. Michelle's close friend admitted: 'She's a very free spirit and before this relationship she has always been terrified of commitment. “And because of her troubled past, many of them have essentially had to be her babysitter or a mother figure to her. 'So now Cara might be younger than her, but she honestly thinks this is 'the one'. Just before she met Cara she was talking about wanting a family within the next couple of years. Lovers? Michelle Rodriguez reportedly dated Vin Diesel, her Fast and Furious co-star. The pair pose at the premiere of Fast and Furious 6 in Seoul, South Korea, in May 2013 . Ex-love: Michelle Rodriguez was also said to have dated her S.W.A.T co-star Olivier Martinez. The actor is now married to Halle Berry . 'She . really wants a baby and wants one soon and now she has found Cara she . thinks this could finally be the time to chase that dream. 'Sadly due to Michelle’s troubled past, Cara’s family are not so sure.They are not 100 per cent pro this relationship and are in some ways willing it to end. 'The 14-year age gap between the girls concerns them as does Michelle's wayward reputation. 'They . know Cara has been swept off her feet by Michelle, who has dropped . everything to be with her young love, but the family fear the . relationship will end in nothing but disaster. 'I highly doubt at 21-years-old Cara is ready to start a family. She is no doubt currently smitten with Michelle, who dropped everything, including her girlfriend and friends, to be with her. 'But . if anyone is going to get their heart broken in this relationship it's . going to be Michelle. She will smother Cara, and wants to be around her . 24 hours a day.' The couple, who apparently met in . January, were also seen attending Prince's secret gig at Ronnie Scott's . club on Monday, February 17, and the Elle Style Awards the following . evening before heading to Milan to . close the autumn/winter fashion season. They then hired a private jet last week to head to Milan Fashion Week, where Cara had a busy schedule. The pair were spotted in coordinating black outfits while carrying bags as they made their way to their airplane - while the Brit beauty's parents were also along for the trip. After landing in Milan, Michelle sat with her love as she sat in hair and makeup backstage at the Fendi autumn/winter 2014 fashion show. They then flew back to London and are now believed to be on vacation. Supportive: The Fast And Furious star hung out with her model squeeze backstage at Milan Fashion Week . Romantic getaway: It seems Michelle's girlfriend Cara Delevingne might be on the Thailand holiday too as that same day she shared a photo of herself wearing scuba diving gear while in a tropical location . Sexy couple: Michelle's post came days after Cara shared this snapshot . Michelle spoke openly about her sexuality in October after years of speculation, telling Entertainment Weekly, 'I've never walked the carpet with anyone, so they wonder: What does she do with her vagina?\" Plus, I play a butchy girl all the time, so they assume I'm a lesbo.' Asked about the assumptions, she admitted: 'Eh, they're not too far off. I've gone both ways. I do as I please. I am too f--king curious to sit here and not try when I can. Men are intriguing. So are chicks.' This week, Michelle posted a picture of herself naked, revealing her bare derriere to the world as she appeared to be meditating. She was seen lapping up the sunshine in Thailand, where she is . currently enjoying a getaway, and the snapshot also showed a stunning . ocean view. And it is likely that the photo was taken by Cara, as that same day the model shared a picture of herself clad . in scuba diving gear in an equally tropical location. Michelle’s snap comes just days after her model squeeze shared her own extremely sexy picture on the social networking site. The source added: 'You can see from the photos of them out together in London that they are clearly having fun. 'They . don't seem to have a care in the world and I know Michelle will pay for . everything, go everywhere with her and has unlimited funds to do as . they please. 'To begin with . this will be nice and she will be flattered. But when she has to go . away to shoot a film, it will end and Michelle does fall hard. 'And maybe it will all be a little too much for someone as young as Cara.' Turning heads: Michelle attended the BAFTAs in London earlier this month in a silk and leather plunging gown .

         "An Australian family who put more than half a million Christmas lights on their house have claimed a world record - for the second time. Father-of-three David Richards from Canberra first won the title in 2011 with 331,038 lights, but was beaten by a family in New York who put up 346,283. His family vowed to take regain the title this Christmas - so installed more than 31 miles of wire with 502,165 lights, glowing reindeer and loud music around their suburban home, to the irritation of some neighbours. Scroll down for video . Blinding: Half a million Christmas lights have wowed and annoyed neighbours in equal measure in Canberra. Speaking about his achievement, father-of-three David Richards, who claimed a world record for the second time, said: 'I just love Christmas' Record: The lights are attached to every possible surface - including trees, hedges, walls and the roof . Glittering: The display at the family's home took more than a month to construct and will cost £1,400 to run . The sight has attracted neighbours from miles around - although not all of them are impressed. Some have not spoken to the family since 2011. Mr Richards, who lives in the suburb of Forrest with his wife Janean, son Aidan, . 13, and daughters Caitlin, ten, and Madelyn, six, insisted most neighbors supported . the display. He added: 'I have always loved . Christmas. Having the Christmas lights with the community coming in and . sharing it is a time when you get to know people you probably should . know better, I guess.' Guinness World Records today confirmed the family's charity feat has officially the most Christmas lights on a residential property. The twinkling bulbs will cost about £1,400 to run for a month - but the sum has been donated by a local power company. Celebration: David Richards, his wife Janean and daughter Madelyn raise a glass to celebrate his remarkable, but unusual achievement . Lit up: Scores of lights can be seen adoring the roof and nearby trees, much to the amazement of the people below . Quite the attraction! The stunt is open to the public - with scores of people already flooding to see the spectacle while many have viewed a video of the lights on YouTube . The stunt is open to the public, and hundreds of people have already visited and posted videos on Youtube. It will raise funds for children's charities including to fight Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. Up to 70,000 people visited the light show when he last put it on in 2011 and it raised £44,000 for charity. This year Mr Richards wants to raise £56,000. He told the Canberra Times: 'It actually helps a lot of families who have put up with an amazing amount of grief. That makes it all worthwhile to me. 'It's like a party in your driveway every night.' Dedication: Mr Richards spent a whole month putting up the lights - which were independently verified by a Guinness World Record official . Happy times: As well as being record breakers, the lights will be used to illuminate the wedding of Mrs Richard's cousin on Saturday .

And they have had an extra use, illuminating the wedding of his wife's cousin on Saturday. Mr Richards vowed he had retired after setting his 2011 record, but regained the taste for Christmas lights. Now he will not rule out defending himself against further challenges. However, he said he will need a generator if he puts up any more lights. Everybody needs good neighbours: Some nearby residents have not been on speaking terms with the Richards family since their previous record in 2011 . Dazzling: The wiring for the display is 31 miles long. If there were any more lights the family would need a generator to run it .",

         "John Yates, 59, pictured outside court today, met Ukrainian Marina Ivleva, 49, online but their marriage ended acrimoniously . An internet bride who made her fortune in the UK after marrying a British man she met online is now fighting her in the divorce courts for a 'fair share' of her wealth. Ukrainian Marina Ivleva, 49, left Crimea for Leicester in 1999 after meeting John Yates through an international dating site and went on to earn more than he did. She had left for Britain for love and a better financial future because the average annual wage can be as low as £2,000-a-year at home. In her 12-years in the UK she has risen to a senior administrator at De Montfort University and amassed assets and cash. Now her truck-driving husband, who lives in a council house after they split two years ago, is taking her to court because he claims he deserves the 'fair share' of her wealth. Mrs Ivleva is living in their home in Leicester with her grown up son from a previous marriage, Robert, 26. Mr Yates says he is languishing with 'nothing' in council accommodation and insists he is due a 'fair share' of her money. The Court of Appeal heard that Mrs Ivleva told Mr Yates that she had divorced him in Ukraine, and this has sparked a bitter legal battle. She then tried to get her foreign divorce recognised in England in March but High Court judge Mr Justice Peter Jackson refused. He said that Mrs Ivleva had 'trailed her coat' by keeping her husband in the dark about details of the Ukrainian proceedings until it was too late for him to do anything about them. Describing their relationship as a 'limping marriage', he said 'basic fairness' to Mr Yates demanded that he be given the opportunity to divorce his wife in England. In his 'emphatic' ruling, the judge said that, although the divorce had been advertised in a Ukrainian newspaper, Mr Yates spoke very little of his wife's native language. In the latest legal skirmish Mrs Ivleva's son spoke on her behalf as she challenged the judge's decision at the Court of Appeal. Split: The couple, pictured together in 2005, broke up two years ago and Mrs Ivleva has claimed that she already secured a divorce in Ukraine - but the British court won't accept it . She claimed to have suffered discrimination as a foreign wife and that the ruling amounted to an 'attack on the integrity' of the Ukrainian courts. However, sitting judge Lady Justice King sided with Mr Yates and described the judge's refusal to recognise her Ukrainian divorce as 'exemplary' and 'unimpeachable'. The ruling opened the way for Mr Yates to pursue his county court divorce petition and seek financial orders against his wife. He said outside court after the ruling: 'She's got everything. I've got nothing and I'm entitled to a fair share. 'I'm living in council accommodation from day-to-day. She can afford to go on holiday. I can't'. He added that he expected his decree nisi to go through on January 5, finally ending his marriage.",

         "Whoopi Goldberg had her The View co-hosts all rallied against her during a discussion in which she supported a highly controversial discipline technique in the third episode of the revamped series Wednesday. With Nicolle Wallace, Rosie O'Donnell and Rosie Perez all shaking their heads in abject disapproval, Whoopi sided with a Michigan dad who recently forced his 4-year-old son to humiliate himself on a roadside with a sign that read 'I hit little girls.' 'That father took a great step and I'm proud of him,' Whoopi said of the man who could lose custody of his son for the stunt. Scroll down for video... Whose side are you on? Whoopi thinks a Michigan man who punished his 4-year-old by forcing him to hold up a humiliating sign was in the right . Rosie Perez was first to shun what Rob Devine forced his son Tristan to do. 'He's a little kid,' the actress asserted, raising her signature voice for one of the first times since joining the show. 'He's 4-years-old, it's a little bit extreme.' Whoopi wouldn't back down, though, so former George W. Bush aide Nicolle Wallace put in her two-cents. 'I don't think you teach a kid a lesson by shaming,' said the communications maven. Then, as if to make amends for the rift that emerged between them on Tuesday, a miracle happened: resident fiery liberal Rosie O'Donnell agree with Wallace. 'Shame is never a way to teach a child anything' said O'Donnell, whose own special-needs son once grappled with a hitting problem before the family sought therapy. 'They're not emotionally ready to understand.' But even in an episode where the panel touched on the Adrian Peterson child abuse issue and selfies in the gynecologist's office, day three was a departure from day two when Wallace and O'Donnell shared some seriously tens . Disagreement: It was Whoopi's turn to anger the group on Wednesday as she sided with a father with some controversial thoughts on displinine . Whoopi agreed: The creative punishment used by Rob Devine (right) when he discovered his son Tristan had been harassing female classmates became a source of a classic The View clash. Nicolle and both Rosies said 4-year-old is too young to humiliate a child . The once-booted co-host compared a characterization Wallace made of Obama's lack of warmth with the 'international incident' that came when rapper Kanye West publicly declared that Bush's response (or lack thereof) to the Katrina disaster meant he hated black people. 'He revealed was how personally wounded he was by that statement,' Wallace said of her then boss, who wrote of his dismay over West's assertion in his 2010 memoir Decision Points. She then called O'Donnell's words 'an attack.' O'Donnell snatched the opportunity to turn Wallace's words against her. 'He was very upset in the plane as he flew over Katrina,' quipped the comedienne. 'It was a very long time before he showed up. That is a fact, not an attack.' Wallace, who just the day before admitted on the show that she had nothing to do with Bush's decision not to visit Katrina--but simply fly over it--was forced to agree. Ironically, on the season's same inaugural episode, O'Donnell made sure to say of Wallace: 'I like her, I swear!' Whether that's true or not, the hot and cold chemistry appears to have worked, at least for the time being. The season 15 premier on Monday won the show its highest ratings in eight years. According to The Wrap, it's the second most watched premier ever for the daytime series. More to come? Republican Nicolle Wallace and liberal Rosie O'Donnell traded some harsh words during a very tense moment on just the second episode of The View's new lineup .",

         "One of the most fascinating aspects of Kevin Pietersen’s autobiography for the public must be the revealing of all the frailties and insecurities professional sportsmen feel in the dressing room. It’s certainly not as harmonious or lovey-dovey as people might presume. Players are always getting on each other’s nerves or having issues to resolve. You hear professional footballers whingeing if they are away for longer than a couple of weeks at a World Cup but international cricketers are away from home for months on end and see more of their team-mates than their families. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Pietersen say a good coach would have managed the situation . Kevin Pietersen has lifted the lid on all the frailties and insecurities in the dressing room . There will always be tensions, particularly when you consider the highly-pressurised environment they work in and that every move they make is scrutinised and analysed. The Manchester United footballers Teddy Sheringham and Andy Cole famously didn’t get on and in my England team Darren Gough and Andy Caddick had their moments, but that doesn’t really matter. As I said in these pages the other day, Michael Holding will tell you that some members of the great West Indies side didn’t get on. Shane Warne will say the same about his Australian team. But once they stepped on that field they respected each other and did everything in their power to win the game for their team. I liken it to sitting an examination every day of the week, and we all know how nervous and tetchy our kids can be the day before an exam. It is why there will always be niggles between team-mates and why they won’t always get on. Team-mates Teddy Sheringham and Andy Cole famously didn't get on at Manchester United . I’ve heard about the accusation of cliques in the England dressing room but that has always been the case and always will be. There will always be groups of three or four players who prefer to spend time with each other. When you are away for three months, you can’t expect everyone to go out together every night. You have to treat players like adults and in return they must have respect for one another even if they are not mates. There was plenty of banter and mickey-taking in the England dressing room when I played but someone like Marcus Trescothick, perhaps because he was teased about his weight when he was young, was always good at reminding anyone to be careful about not crossing the line. Rarely would we have a go at each other about cricketing mistakes because it was all so important but Mike Atherton, for one, would always remind me if I got out to a bad shot. It was just that he would wait a few days before doing so. Darren Gough (left) and Andy Caddick had their moments when Nasser Hussain was England captain . That is not bullying to me and I can honestly say I have never considered any cross words or mickey-taking in any England team I have played in — or watched — to be bullying. Yes, the England team is a tough school but if you can’t cope with a few tough words from your team-mates how are you going to cope with Mitchell Johnson and Brad Haddin? But I do agree with some of what Pietersen has said. I have long disagreed with how often the England bowlers would have a go at anyone who misfielded or dropped a catch and I was amazed at how long that was allowed to continue. Apart from anything else it plays into the hands of the opposition. They will look at that and say: ‘We’ve got this lot on the run. They are at each other.’ It just wasn’t a good look and I’m glad that there seems less of that sort of thing now. Nasser Hussain tried to embrace ‘difficult characters' like Phil Tufnell when he was England captain . And if it is true that people had to stand up in front of the group and apologise when they made a mistake then England should be careful. That really is school yard stuff. The flip side is that you want your team to be challenged and pushed to make sure they perform to the best of their ability, and it is not always the captain or the coach who does the challenging. For me, it would hit a lot harder if one of my team-mates, rather than the coach or captain, had a word with me after something and said: ‘Come on Nas, you can do better than that.’ Clearly, this England team pushed each other hard and it seems Pietersen didn’t like to be treated in that way. It does seem that England may have had a tendency to overdo the methods that took them to three Ashes triumphs and No 1 in the world Test rankings. The admonishing of players in the field is one example. Another is their reliance on statistics when, at times, they should have trusted their cricketing instinct more. When I was captain I would try to embrace the so-called ‘difficult characters’ and do everything to concentrate on what they could do rather than what they couldn’t. If people like Phil Tufnell, Caddick and Graham Thorpe could take wickets and score runs for us then they were fine by me. Andy Flower (right) tried to keep KP onside so England would benefit from his considerable talent . You have to treat everyone differently. Pietersen and Alastair Cook have almost identical career records and are two of the best batsmen England have ever had, but as human beings they could not be more different and have to be treated as such. The key with KP, clearly, was trying to keep him happy and make him feel loved. But coach Andy Flower will tell you he did that for five years, he treated Pietersen differently and did everything to manage him and get him onside so England would benefit from the match-winning innings of which he was capable. It’s all very well people saying Kevin was easy to manage when he first came into the side but he would have been wouldn’t he? He was a young player finding his way and there’s no way he would have challenged anyone senior. Pietersen's lucrative contract with Indian Premier League had repercussions for England team . Where everything clearly changed is with the advent of the Indian Premier League. It seemed to make Pietersen believe he was bigger than the team, and perhaps other players became jealous of the money he was making. The dynamic of one of the most successful of all England teams clearly changed. Flower had tired of repeatedly trying to manage Pietersen. When results started going against England and their star batsman was not quite looking like the player he once was, England decided enough was enough. As I have said, there are some valid points here but nearly everyone who has tried to manage him has found him incredibly hard work. Everybody can’t be wrong. So maybe one day Kevin Pietersen might take a look at himself rather than blaming everyone else for the way he has been treated by England. He might have to look back and say: ‘Was it me?’",

         "By . Daily Mail Reporter . Soviet spies have admitted using bugging devices on the Royal Family and former British Prime Minister Harold Wilson. Secret agents from the KGB targeted Princess Margaret in the 1960s, attaching listening aids to her lighter, cigarette case, ashtrays and telephones. According to the Sunday Express, they homed in on the Princess during a trip to Copenhagen, Denmark in 1964. Lord Snowdon And Princess Margaret get ready to board a plane in September 1964 ahead of their visit to Copenhagen. Russian spies have admitted bugging the Princess on the trip . Until now, Russia has always denied the covert operation, which took place in a hotel, but has now admitted compiling a dossier on the Princess's love affair with Robin Douglas-Home and further relationships with Roddy Llewellyn, Colin Tennant and Dominic Ewes, a painter who later committed suicide. Spies passed photos, tape recordings and 'most interesting, even scandalous' gossip involving senior royal figures. It is also said agents tried to get information from Margaret's therapist, Kay Kiernan, who also treated the Queen. Intelligence on Prince Phillip was gathered via society osteopath and artist Stephen Ward, who later killed himself at the height of the Profumo affair. But spies failed in a sting operation on then future leader Harold Wilson, setting up a 'honey trap' for him in a Moscow hotel. Princess Margaret (second from right and then left) was targeted by KGB spies on her visit to Copenhagen in 1964. Bugging devices were planted in her lighter, cigarette case, ashtrays and telephones . A new book will detail the KGB spies' attempts at bugging the Royal Family. Pictured, the Kremlin, in Moscow . Female agents posing as prostitutes patrolled the hotel overlooking the Kremlin, with a camera planted in a chandelier in his bedroom. But when the film was developed, Wilson's face was disguised. Colonel Vadim Goncharov, who has since died, was the KGB chief in charge of the snooping operations, and he was ordered by bosses to go on television to deny the claims, fearing they would cast a shadow over the Queen's first and only visit to Russia in 1994. But last week Russia newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda boasted that among Goncharov's successes was 'the bugging of drunken parties of the British Princess Margaret'. A book published next year, Entitled The Kremlin v The Windsors, by the paper's intelligence analyst Gennady Sokolov will provide further details of the operation, according to the paper. Master spy Goncharov, who staged stings in more than 100 countries and survived assassination attempts, said of the Princess Margaret operation: 'As I recall there were no lovers, though there was a visitor. 'On this occasion our interest was in getting confidential information which would open certain doors for us in Britain.' On the failed attempt at trapping Wilson, he said: 'It was if he was playing games with us.'",

         "County Kildare, Ireland (CNN) -- The mayor of a town in Ireland has resigned and faces a possible police investigation after saying he would no longer represent people of black African origin. Councillor Darren Scully was Mayor of Naas in County Kildare, near the Irish capital, Dublin. Interviewed on local radio Tuesday morning, Scully said he had decided not to represent black Africans because of their \"aggressive\" attitude to him. \"I have been met with aggressiveness, I have been met with bad manners,\" he claimed. \"I have also been played the race card - it's been said 'Oh yeah, you will help white people, but you don't help black people'.\" The then mayor continued: \"After a while I made a decision that I was just not going to take on representations from black Africans, that I would be very courteous to them and I would pass on their query to other public representatives who would take their concerns.\" Members of other political parties called for Scully to resign and Tuesday evening he did just that. He issued the following statement: \"I wish to apologise unreservedly for my remarks on 4FM and KFM. I realise they have caused deep hurt and offence in all communities and in all sectors of society. \"I have been proud to be Mayor of Naas and to represent all the people of the town. However, as a result of the upset that I have caused, I feel it is appropriate that I step down from this position.\" Earlier, political rivals Sinn Fein had accused him of being racist, but in his statement Scully denied the claim. He said: \"I realise now that my remarks were open to an interpretation that I did not intend. I abhor racism in all its forms.\" Naas Town Council had called a special meeting for Tuesday evening to discuss the controversy, but Scully resigned just ahead of it. The now ex-mayor is a member of the main party in the Irish coalition government - Fine Gael - but said he was expressing personal views. The party agreed - Fine Gael issued this statement: \"The views expressed by Cllr Scully do not reflect the views of Fine Gael and they are not party policy. \"Fine Gael is an inclusive party and we are trying to build a country that caters for all.\" A lawmaker with the junior partners in the coalition government, Aodhan O Riordain of the Labour Party, said he had reported the matter to Irish police with a view to prosecution. O Riordain branded Scully's comments \"outrageous\" and said they could be considered as incitement to hatred. The Irish census of 2006 showed there were 1,862 people of African origin living in Kildare out of a population in the county of 186,335, according to the Central Statistics Office in Dublin. Naas has a total population of just over 20,000. Local people told CNN Tuesday that race relations in the town are good and they were \"really surprised\" a local representative would make such comments.",

         "By . Suzannah Hills . Cuba's reclusive former President Fidel Castro has been photographed in public for the first time in almost a year. The revolutionary leader attended the inauguration of an art gallery in Havana run by Cuban artist Alexis Leyva, aka Kcho, yesterday. It is the first time Castro has been seen in public since attending a National Assembly meeting in February 2013. Public appearance: Fidel Castro, Cuba's former President and revolutionary leader, looks at the camera during a rare public appearance to attend the inauguration of an art gallery in Havana, Cuba . Support: Castro is helped into the gallery by an aide and a metal walking stick . Castro, who ceded power to his brother Raul Castro in 2008 after falling ill in 2006, has kept a low profile in recent years. But his silence in the wake of Nelson Mandela's death prompted widespread speculation that his health is ailing. The former South African president was a close ally, thanks to Cuba's backing of Angolan fighters who battled forces supported by the previous pro-apartheid South African government of the 1980s. This prompted the release of pictures in December of Castro meeting with a Spanish reporter about current events for more than two hours earlier that month. Recluse: The appearance is the first time Castro has been seen in public since attending a National Assembly meeting in February 2013 . Speculation: Castro's low profile prompted fears about the state of his health . The photo shows Castro, 87, seated and wearing a blue sweatsuit, looking intensely at writer Ignacio Ramonet and gesturing with his left hand. Mr Ramonet and the website Cubadebate say the photo was taken early December. The reporter told the AP that he and Castro discussed a wide range of topics including Mandela, Venezuelan politics and climate change. 'I found him to be in excellent health and in a good mood, physically, mentally and psychologically,' Mr Ramonet said. Castro left power after 47 years after suffering serious intestinal bleeding in 2006, handing his duties to his brother Raul. Castro looks closely at an art piece during a rare public appearance to attend the inauguration of an art gallery run by Cuban artist Alexis Leyva, aka Kcho . Poor health: Castro left power after 47 years after suffering serious intestinal bleeding in 2006 . While Fidel Castro has been out of the spotlight due to his health, his brother Raul has been making enough headlines for them both as he caused a stir after shaking President Obama's hand during the public memorial ceremony for Mandela in South Africa. It then emerged that representatives from the two historically antagonistic nations had already been in talks for six months. During the president's trip back from South Africa, Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes told reporters on Air Force One that 'it's been quite some time since the Presidents of the United States and Cuba were even in the same place.' But he acknowledged that 'we’re in talks on issues associated with migration that, again, I think allow for there to be greater connectivity particularly among Cuban Americans and Cuba.' Castro ceded power to his brother Raul Castro in 2008 and has kept a low profile ever since . Official pictures have been released of Castro in recent months to quell the mounting speculation over his health .",

         "A devastated son whose father was beheaded and his mother abducted a week ago today said he now hopes she is dead to ‘ease her suffering’ as it is too unbearable to think of her in pain. Retired Russell Dermond’s decapitated body was found at his exclusive, lake-front home last Tuesday, but his wife of 62 years Shirley has vanished, in a suspected kidnapping. Investigators in Putnam County, Georgia are completely baffled by the gruesome crime and no one can understand why anyone would want to harm the beloved elderly couple. Nothing was taken from their $1m home, their car keys and cellphones were left behind. Scroll down for video . Unspeakable: Shirley Dermond, 87, has not been seen for more than a week after her husband's decapitated body was found at their home. Their son, Keith, said: 'If she is still alive, we can’t imagine . what she is going through… but it . has almost got to the stage where we hope she is with our father, just . to ease her suffering' Mystery: No-one has been able to think of why anyone would want to harm Shirley and Russell. Nothing was taken, their cellphones and car keys were left behind. Police have ruled out a mob hit and that Russell was in witness protection. And their family they can't believe it is linked to the drug murder of son, Mark, in 2000 . The police have been forced to deny they were taken out in a mob hit and their despairing family have also denied their is any link between the horror and the killing of one of the couple's son's in a drug deal gone wrong. Officers have been dredging a nearby lake and searching woods for clues, but as yet the local Sheriff says they have no leads. They still haven’t found 88-year-old Mr Dermond’s severed head. One of the Dermond’s three heartbroken children, Keith said the family had been wracking their brains to try to come up with any possible motive, but they say their parents didn’t have a single enemy in the world. He is still desperate for the safe return of his 87-year-old mother, but the idea of her suffering at the hands of a, ‘sick’ murderer is just too much for him to bear. Speaking to MailOnline, Keith, 55, from Jacksonville, Florida, said: ‘We are completely devastated, but our primary focus is finding our mother. The thought of her suffering is just unbearable. ‘Each hour that goes by, my brother, my sister and me are becoming more resigned to the fact that we may never see her again and we may never know what happened. ‘If she is still alive, we can’t imagine what she is going through. The human spirit is incredibly strong… but it has almost got to the stage where we hope she is with our father, just to ease her suffering. ‘Whoever did this was so sick in the head that I just can’t imagine it.’ Sick: Keith, pictured center left with wife Kathleen and other family members, said: 'The more we think about it, the more it makes sense that this was just some sick individual who randomly targeted them.' He added it could have been the work of a cult . Russell Dermond was last seen May 1 at a supermarket not far from his home in the gated Reynolds Plantation east of Atlanta. Shirley Dermond had started the next day’s newspaper crossword puzzle, but no one had taken the couple’s May 3 mail out of their mailbox. That same day, last Saturday, the Dermonds failed to show up at a friend’s Kentucky Derby party. According to Putnam County Sheriff, Howard Sills, financial and phone records have not turned up anything to suggest the Dermonds would be the target of criminal activity. Since the murder speculation about a potential motive has been rife. Sheriff Sills has been forced to deny rumors that Mr Dermond – whose body was found in his garage - was in a witness protection program and may have been killed by mobsters. He has also said there is no evidence that the brutal crime was in some way linked to the murder of the couple’s son Mark in a drug deal gone wrong in 2000. Mark was gunned down in Atlanta as he apparently tried to buy crack cocaine on his birthday. Troy Major was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment for murder. He was also hit with consecutive terms of 20 years for aggravated assault and five years for possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony. He has tried to appeal twice, but both attempts were denied. And Keith says that while his brother Brad, his sister Leslie and him have considered a possible link between their brother’s slaying and their father’s murder, It just doesn’t make sense. Isolated: Keith reckons they may have been targeted not because of their wealth - as they have richer neighbors either side, but because they live at the end of a cul-de-sac with no other houses that close . Discovery: Officers dredge a lake during the search for Shirley Dermond. Her body was found by a fisherman . He said: ‘People have tried to link this to my brother’s murder. We have obviously thought about that, because it is a violent connection to my parents, but that doesn’t make sense either. ‘The individual is still in jail and anyway, my parents weren’t really involved in the case at the time. They didn’t attend court, so if this was some kind of revenge, they would not be obvious targets. ‘It is a complete mystery as far as we are concerned. We have been wracking our brains trying to think of anyone who may have wanted to do this, but we have no idea. ‘My father hadn’t been in business for 20 years. He just spent his time relaxing and playing golf. He just didn’t have any enemies. ‘The more we think about it, the more it makes sense that this was just some sick individual who randomly targeted them. ‘My parents live at the end of a cul-de-sac, so they have no neighbors either side. Maybe that’s why they were targeted? ‘It could have been anything, something to do with a cult, we just don’t know. There were definitely people in that neighborhood who would be more obvious targets if it was a robbery. My parents were comfortable, but they definitely weren’t wealthy.’ Keith and his siblings initially flew to Georgia to try to help with the investigation, but they have not been allowed in the house - where many happy family parties were held over the years - because it is still a crime scene. Now they have returned home where they are playing an unbearable waiting game, desperately hoping for news about their mother one way or the other. And heartbreakingly, Sheriff Howard Sills has said he is not optimistic she’ll be found alive. Speaking on Tuesday, he said: ‘I’m running down one thing after another and coming up empty.’ There was speculation that an elderly woman who turned up dazed and confused Monday at a Tampa hospital was Shirley Dermond, but that has been completely dismissed. Concern: The alarm was raised when the couple failed to turn up to a Kentucky Derby party . And Sills said rumors of organized crime involvement are unfounded. He said: ‘No, the man wasn’t in witness protection. He wasn’t going to testify. There’s no evidence of any kind of torture.’ On Tuesday, they enlisted the aid of a Department of Natural Resources submarine robot to scour the deep peninsula off Lake Oconee outside the couple’s home. So far, they’ve turned up nothing. Sills said he had also dispatched deputies to a wooded area near the crime scene in the hope they would discover some kind of clue. Keith – who like his late father, manages a chain of restaurants - said: ‘The Sheriff is keeping us informed as much as he can. I spoke to him yesterday. He is holding back some information as it is important to the case. ‘The house is still a crime scene, they are looking for finger prints and dredging the lake, but there just doesn’t seem to be much in terms of leads.’ He added: ‘My parents were married for 62 years.

was in a witness protection program and may have been killed by mobsters.', 'He has also said there is no evidence that the brutal crime was in some way linked to the murder of the couple’s son Mark in a drug deal gone wrong in 2000.', 'Mark was gunned down in Atlanta as he apparently tried to buy crack cocaine on his birthday.', 'Troy Major was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment for murder.', 'He was also hit with consecutive terms of 20 years for aggravated assault and five years for possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony.', 'He has tried to appeal twice, but both attempts were denied.', 'And Keith says that while his brother Brad, his sister Leslie and him have considered a possible link between their brother’s slaying and their father’s murder, It just doesn’t make sense.', 'Isolated: Keith reckons they may have been targeted not because of their wealth -

where many happy family parties were held over the years - because it is still a crime scene.', 'Now they have returned home where they are playing an unbearable waiting game, desperately hoping for news about their mother one way or the other.', 'And heartbreakingly, Sheriff Howard Sills has said he is not optimistic she’ll be found alive.', 'Speaking on Tuesday, he said: ‘I’m running down one thing after another and coming up empty.’ There was speculation that an elderly woman who turned up dazed and confused Monday at a Tampa hospital was Shirley Dermond, but that has been completely dismissed.', 'Concern: The alarm was raised when the couple failed to turn up to a Kentucky Derby party .', 'And Sills said rumors of organized crime involvement are unfounded.', 'He said: ‘No, the man wasn’t in witness protection.', 'He wasn’t going to testify.', 'There’s no evidence of any kind of torture.’ On Tuesday, they enlisted the aid of a Department of Natural Resources submarine robot to scour the deep peninsula off Lake Oconee outside the couple’s home.', 'So far, they’ve turned up nothing.', 'Sills said he had also dispatched deputies to a wooded area near the crime scene in the hope they would discover some kind of clue.', 'Keith – who like his late father, manages a chain of restaurants - said: ‘The Sheriff is keeping us informed as much as he can.', 'I spoke to him yesterday.', 'He is holding back some information as it is important to the case.', '‘The house is still a crime scene, they are looking for finger prints and dredging the lake, but there just doesn’t seem to be much in terms of leads.’ He added: ‘My parents were married for 62 years.', 'Family was everything to them.', 'Their happiest times were spent with us, that’s what they loved doing.', 'We just pray someone who knows something comes forward and puts an end to all of this.’']"
